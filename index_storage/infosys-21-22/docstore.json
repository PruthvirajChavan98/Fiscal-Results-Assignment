Infosys: The journey to realizing our collective potential\nIt is often said that if you are \noverwhelmed by the size of a problem, \nbreak it down into smaller pieces. \nEspecially those that we think of \nas daunting, overwhelming, and \nincredibly hard \u2013 they can all be \naccomplished by taking on small parts \nat\u00a0a time. Or can they?\nIn business, these parts are mostly linked together and \nconventional wisdom leads one to think that improving \nthe parts, one at a time, will improve the whole. The truth, \nhowever, is that a business is rarely, if ever, transformed \nin this way because this approach misses the vital \nintersections between the parts, where value can leak and \nbe lost. As navigators of our clients\u2019 transformation, we \nunderstand the power of a unified, all-encompassing and \nconcerted effort. It\u2019s all about the enterprise acting as one \nin service of a common goal. So, when it came to our own \ntransformation, we knew we had to start at the foundation \nthat holds together all our business units and functions, \ntarget the top and bottom layers of our workforce along \nwith everyone in between, and let our shared purpose \nlead the way. We call this approach to our reinvention \n\u2013\u00a0One Infosys.\nLike our clients, across industries, we too are racing \nto increase the digitalization of our ways of working. \nIn\u00a0addition to strengthening our capabilities in automation, \ndata analytics, AI, digital experience and cybersecurity, \nwe are amplifying the outcomes of these improvements \nwith the cloud. Infosys Cobalt\u2122 \u2013 our powerful set of \nservices, solutions, and platforms for enterprises \u2013 is \nalready accelerating cloud-powered transformation for \nour clients. Boosting of our own digital muscle with the \ncloud is additionally helping us embrace agile ways of \nworking, drive faster application development, and assure \nbetter digital security across projects. As a result, we are \nable to bring new capabilities, with greater relevance to \nour clients\u2019 agendas in days rather than months, while \nsharing the benefits of better cost-managed solutions and \nfaster modernization.Beyond the technology, we know it is our people who \ntranslate and integrate new digital methods and processes \ninto existing ways of working, orchestrating success for our \nclients. Our transformation required that every employee \nhad the digital skills to execute the envisioned change and \nevery leader knew how to help their teams think and act in \nsync in their day-to-day work. We redoubled our reskilling \nand upskilling efforts company-wide so that every \nemployee was enabled and incentivized to deliver better \noutcomes and every manager could make a compelling \ncase for change while acting as a role model to inspire \nothers to move forward.\nWithout losing focus on bottom-line results, our \nOne\u00a0Infosys approach to transformation also seeks to \naddress issues of broader relevance such as climate \nchange and the employment implications of advances \nin automation and artificial intelligence. We know that \nthe potential of our digital prowess to make a difference \nand our role as a responsible corporation stretches far \nbeyond the well -being of our employees and customers. \nMany\u00a0businesses look to us for guidance, and the \nindustry looks to us for inspiration. Every Infoscion, we \nknow, is driven by the idea of leaving the world a better \nplace than it was when they started to be part of the \nInfosys ecosystem.\nWe hope to share glimpses, in this Integrated Annual \nReport, of how the One Infosys approach is accelerating \nall-round progress for all our stakeholders.\nInfosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22\n1\n1", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3638, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "295796e5-6fc6-4bd2-91fc-5e420763b2b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "295796e5-6fc6-4bd2-91fc-5e420763b2b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1e51f46a-3afa-4736-88b2-94abd2d15733", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "3", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "34f35159bfda5ffbced33075f0ac57cfe1f1c02807edb88f02f2426ec35f3201", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1d6681ca-0dd7-4f72-aad1-fb4545173a8e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3e0fd4a60fb84e00ef08be7f8e1dca624ebb251cfc80943c3ed4b82b186c988c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b58d8727-f581-482a-9881-fef99900d6de", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc3908ebdb3e193fd99ab58e17550e80c3827976bad265b502b4ad4029152cee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "One digital foundation \u2013 unified by cloud\nThe future of customer experience  \nis in the cloud \nOne of the most puzzling challenges of our times is determining \nchanging customer behaviors and trends.

The challenge is \ntwo -fold\u00a0\u2013\u00a0shining a light on insights amid the chaos and multiple \nsources of data, as also building the performance infrastructure \nthat can pivot on demand to where these insights point.\nCompanies are harnessing the power of the cloud and \ncloud -native platforms for both.\nKeen to be ever relevant to our clients\u2019 agenda, we launched \nInfosys Equinox to help enterprises deliver hyper-segmented, \npersonalized omnichannel commerce experiences for B2B and \nB2C buyers. With this cloud-native platform, enterprises, across \nindustries like retail, CPG, telecom, manufacturing, automotive \nand media, can pick and choose microservices and pre-built \nexperiences to build their own curated digital journeys.\nTake, for instance, Nu Skin Enterprises, a global leader in beauty \nand wellness that thrives on delivering engaging and innovative \nexperiences for their consumers and affiliates. They are keen \nto scale their business model with connected commerce \ncapabilities. This means being able to deliver and quickly scale \nshopping experiences across multiple touchpoints, including \nwebsites, mobile apps, social media and smart connected \ndevices. Digital advances that can prove valuable on this journey \ninclude social commerce, conversational commerce, augmented \nreality, and IoT commerce, which if implemented, will enable \nthem to engage with consumers through rich digital experiences.\nNu Skin is looking to take advantage of the cloud and Infosys \nEquinox to reimagine how they connect with their customers \nand create a new paradigm for personalized beauty and \nwellness shopping.\nAmbeshwar Nath\nSVP \u2013 Industry HeadCloud adoption to accelerate  \nNext Gen Transformation \nWhile several organizations have successfully adopted a \ncloud -first strategy to build new digital capabilities and \ntransform their businesses, the journey to the cloud can be \nchallenging for some.\nWe\u2019ve learned from our transformation journey and those of our \nclients that this means embracing the cloud not to make one-off \ntactical decisions but as part of a holistic strategy to modernize \nthe technology landscape and drive new business and operating \nmodels. The focus needs to be on end-to-end transformation \nof business capabilities through the standardization and \nautomation of the technology environment, open API model, \nrejuvenated security posture, agile ways of working and \nleveraging these new capabilities to drive quick build-learn-build \niterations. The cloud then acts as a force multiplier.\nCloud is now also looked upon more as a revenue generator \nfor business and not just the CIO\u2019s program for cost-savings \nor efficiency. As a result, in several industries such as financial \nservices, healthcare and others, industry-specific clouds \nare being set up to address the specific customer, business \nprocess, risk and regulatory requirements of the particular kind \nof business.\nCitizens is an exemplar. The bank has developed several APIs, set \nup its landing zone in the cloud, migrated existing applications, \nand built new cloud-first applications while leveraging deep \nautomation for both applications and infrastructure. While there \nwas a big focus on modern technology and agile practices, \nrobust controls are in place to ensure that all core systems \nare resilient, and the legacy infrastructure is upgraded and \nconnected across ITSM processes.\nDennis Gada\nSVP \u2013 Industry HeadAmplifying data and AI with cloud \nOrganizations apply data-driven and agile-driven \napproaches\u00a0\u2013\u00a0from predictive systems to AI-driven \nautomation\u00a0\u2013\u00a0but mostly sporadically.

Artificial \nintelligence and software-powered automation, especially over \nthe past decade, have mechanized prior generations of routine \nwork. Some jobs, with automatable predictable steps have \nbeen lost, with many others created, and almost all of them \nwill no doubt continue to change with growing digitalization. \nThe\u00a0pandemic that raged over the past several months \naccelerated the adoption of digital and dramatically disrupted \nlabor markets driving organizations to reevaluate every aspect of \nwork. At Infosys, we too have adapted and evolved.\nAs an organization, we deeply value learnability \u2013 the potential \nto learn anything so we can do all the things to which we \naspire. This continues to serve us well, especially in tandem \nwith our significant investments in structured reskilling and \nupskilling campaigns for employees, as they learn to harness \nnew opportunities and learn new skills. This also includes better \nsupport for managers by, among other things, educating them \nabout the positive and negative impact they have on their teams, \nand training them in managerial skills, such as providing and \nreceiving feedback. We are also exploring novel ways to amplify \norganization-wide empathetic interactions, offset the deficits \nin social capital as we tackle the need to redesign processes to \nbetter support a hybrid work model.\nWe also see this as an opportunity to strengthen aspects of our \nculture that will provide stability, social cohesion, and a sense of \nbelonging to all our employees while setting ourselves up for \nsuccess in the future.\nSushanth Tharappan\nSVP \u2013 Head \u2013 Leadership DevelopmentWhere careers don\u2019t stand still\nWhile helping our clients navigate their next, our own ambitious \njourney to the next in the world of digital, is steered by our \nemployees.

Our shared sense of purpose gives us all \nthe emotional fuel to put our best foot forward on \nevery dimension.\nThe future \u2013 full of uncertainties \u2013 is not something that \nany of us can claim to predict. Rising interest rates, the \nsituation in Ukraine, the lingering impact of COVID in many \nparts of the world, the disruption of supply chains, all \naccompanied by mounting costs and increased volatility, \nis confronting corporate leaders with complexities and \nchallenges that are only just being understood. At the \nsame time, digital acceleration is creating tremendous \nnew opportunities for differentiation and gaining market \nleadership. Infosys is a trusted navigator for our clients as \nthey seek to create value from technology-led innovation \nand business transformation. We know that we have never \nhad as much potential as we do right now, to leverage our \nexpertise to benefit our clients and the broader society. \nThis opportunity that lies before us \u2013 to make an indelible \nmark with our digital prowess, our empathy for clients, \nour investment in employees and a renewed sense of \npurpose - is greater than it has ever been.

This required \ncompany-wide orchestration of our strengths, deep \ncollaboration amongst our leaders and synergizing of all \nour business units and service lines. Salil has delivered \nindustry leading performance for the Company, and it is in \nthe interest of the Company and its stakeholders to secure \nthe continuity and stability of the current leadership. I am \ndelighted that the Board has unanimously recommended \nto the shareholders to approve the reappointment of Salil \nParekh as Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, \ntill March 31, 2027.\nThe imperative to bring all our assets and capabilities \nto every client interaction required us to reimagine our \nown digital infrastructure, which we have done with \nthe \u2018Live Enterprise\u2019 approach over the last few years. \nThe digital transformation happening across industries, \naccelerated by the pandemic, also meant that we needed \nto strengthen our own offerings, along with deepening \nour understanding of the latest technology trends. \nFor\u00a0example, the continuous investments we are making in \nInfosys Cobalt\u2122-led cloud solutions is differentiating us as \nwe assist our clients to become more agile and responsive \nin this new paradigm of how enterprises use technology.\nOur people-first collaborative culture \u2013 staying invested \nin talent, even as we scale our workforce globally to \ncapitalize on expanding market opportunities \u2013 is integral \nto the One Infosys approach.

From an IT perspective, the \nrenewal translates to reimagining human-machine \ninterfaces, extracting value out of digitized data, \nbuilding next-generation software applications and \nplatforms, harnessing the efficiency of distributed cloud \ncomputing, modernizing legacy technology landscapes \nand strengthening information security and data \nprivacy controls.\nThe fast pace of technology change and the need \nfor technology professionals who are highly skilled \nin both traditional and digital technology are driving \nbusinesses to rely on third parties to realize their business \ntransformation.

fight waves of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, our priority remains the safety and \nwell -being of our employees, and business continuity for our \nclients. Business continuity programs were tested and practiced, \nand the processes were proven to be resilient. We received the \nISO 22301 Business Continuity Management System certification \nfor being a company with resilient processes. \nConsidering employee safety as paramount, we implemented \nelaborate support measures for employees during the three \nCOVID-19 waves in India, and at our global locations. We \noperated dedicated COVID Care Centers in 14 cities in India \nand also established tie-ups with more than 1,500 hospitals \nin 323 cities in India for the treatment of employees and their \nfamilies. We also established a 24x7 war room and help-desk-\ncoordinated support measures, such as tie-ups with testing \nlabs and ambulance services providers, video consultation with \ndoctors, COVID leave provision, insurance coverage, oxygen \nconcentrators, medicines, fresh food, and counselling support. \nDuring the COVID waves, we provided emergency support \n(hospital beds / ventilators / plasma / oxygen) for over 6,100 \nemployees / family members and addressed more than 78,000 \nqueries for COVID medical support.

Resource \nconservation is important to ensure a healthy environment \nand equitable distribution in society. At Infosys, what started \nas a simple energy-metering exercise in 2008 to identify \nwastage and opportunities for savings resulted in one of the \nlargest enterprise-level resource conservation initiatives. \nSuper -efficient new buildings, deep retrofits in existing \nbuildings, smart automation, water management initiatives and \nwaste management projects have contributed to reducing our \nenvironmental impact significantly. We have been able to grow \nour business in a sustainable manner, following the principle of \ncircularity and efficient use of resources.\nInvestments in renewable energy have helped in reducing our \nemissions, and high-impact carbon offset projects have enabled \nus to offset our un-avoidable emissions.\nEnergy:  Our new buildings continue to push the boundaries \nof innovation and efficiency, setting an example for the \nindustry. Our enterprise-level energy-efficiency retrofit \nprogram transforms existing buildings into efficient ones. \nSmart automation has enabled remote monitoring, control and \noptimization of building operations across over 33.81 million \nsq.\u00a0ft. of space. This has helped us manage our operations \nefficiently and uninterrupted in the current situation caused by \nthe pandemic, ensuring the health and safety of employees as \nwell as operations personnel. \nInitiatives:  Retrofits of existing data center UPS with modular \ntypes in data center to reduce PUE, constant monitoring, \nanalysis of the work station UPS were undertaken during \nthe year. We were able to optimize HVAC operation through \nconsolidation of buildings.\nEnergy-efficiency retrofits have helped us reduce our connected \nload over the years by over 34.82 MW. Retrofit projects were \ntaken up for the following reasons: resource conservation, \nend -of-life of equipment, indoor environment quality \nimprovement, and technology upgrade. \nThe capital investment in energy conservation projects was \nabout ` 4 crore in fiscal 2022.\nRenewable energy:  We have a total capacity of 60 MW of solar PV, \nincluding rooftop and ground-mounted systems. We continue to pursue green power purchase from third-party power producers \nand continue working with governments to enable favorable \npolicies for scaling up green power by corporates in India.\nGreen buildings:  In fiscal 2022, our new buildings in Bengaluru, \nMysuru and Thiruvananthapuram in India and Indianapolis in \nthe US were awarded the LEED Platinum certification from the \nUS Green Building Council. We also received the IGBC (Indian \nGreen Building Council) Platinum certification for our buildings \nin Chennai and Bhubaneswar. With this, we now have 45 projects \nat Infosys with the highest level of green building certification, \nspanning a total area of 28.61 million sq.ft. An\u00a0additional 2.1 \nmillion sq.ft. of our projects is currently undergoing green \nbuilding certification.\nHealthy and efficient workspace: A retrofit program to enhance \nthe availability of fresh air in the air conditioning systems in office \nbuildings was implemented across Infosys, to improve air quality \nand provide healthy workspaces for employees. This would \nalso reduce the spread of infections in general. The\u00a0reference \nfor this program was the World Health Organization roadmap \nto improve and ensure good ventilation, in the context of \nCOVID-19.

This information can be used to alert the \nmanagement when thresholds are exceeded, reducing repair time and increasing availability. In addition, datacenter standards \nare revised with a focus on delivering industry leading PUE and \nwill be integrated with DCIM through Smart PDUs for providing a \nunified view of IT and facility subsystems.\nEnterprise storage:  We continue to provide around 1.8PB \nstorage capacity for employees, revenue projects and internal \nrequirements on All Flash storage with Fabric Pool and Storage \nGrid technology. Data is marked hot and cold based on policy, \ncold data is automatically moved onto cheaper larger capacity \nstorage, thereby achieving tiering of data and savings in terms \nof Data Center footprint, power consumption and cooling. This \nresulted in CO2 reduction of 681.88 metric ton per year and \npower saving of 14,32,811 kWh per year. \nCloud-native development environment:  The open source-based \ncloud-native development platform is built on Hyper Converged \nInfrastructure (HCI) and compute which has helped in data center \nfootprint reduction by 80% along with the reduction in power \nand cooling consumption by 30%. \nAwards and recognition \u2013 Information systems \nAward Theme Award sponsor (Company)\nTechCircle \nBusiness TransformationExcellence in digital execution \u2013 Workforce transformation MINT | Tech Circle\nCIO 100 by IDG Award Using IT in innovative ways to deliver business value IDG / Foundry\nCIO 100 Global Digital business growth through technology innovation IDG / Foundry\nCII DX Awards Implementing IT solutions, policy and technologies in \ninnovative and sustainable wayCII\nInnovative CIO Innovative IT project CIO Axis \u2013 BitStream Media-works Pvt.

Risks related to legislation and regulatory compliance\n\u2022 Initially, the COVID-19 pandemic led to substantial increases \nin unemployment rates across certain countries in which we \noperate, including the United States, United Kingdom, EU and \nAustralia. A key risk at that time was widespread enactment \nof restrictive legislation and regulations which would limit \ncompanies in those countries from outsourcing work to us \nor could inhibit our ability to staff client projects in a timely \nmanner thereby impacting our revenue and profitability. \n\u2022 New and changing regulatory compliance, corporate \ngovernance and public disclosure requirements add \nuncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs \nof compliance.\n\u2022 The intellectual property laws of India do not give sufficient \nprotection to software and the related intellectual property \nrights to the same extent as those in the United States. We \nmay be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property \nrights. We may also be subject to third party claims of \nintellectual property infringement.\n\u2022 Our net income would decrease if the government of India \nreduces or withdraws tax benefits and other incentives it \nprovides to us or when our tax holidays expire, reduce or \nterminate.\n\u2022 In the event that the government of India or the government \nof another country changes its tax policies in a manner that \nis adverse to us, our tax expense may materially increase, \nreducing our profitability.\n\u2022 We operate in jurisdictions that impose transfer pricing and \nother tax-related regulations on us, and any failure to comply \ncould materially and adversely affect our profitability.\n\u2022 Changes in the policies of the government of India or political \ninstability may adversely affect economic conditions in India \ngenerally, which could impact our business and prospects.\n\u2022 Attempts to fully address concerns of activist shareholders \nmay divert the time and attention of our management and \nBoard of Directors and may impact the prices of our equity \nshares and ADSs. \n\u2022 Our international expansion plans subject us to risks inherent \nto doing business internationally.\n\u2022 Our ability to acquire companies organized outside India may \ndepend on the approval of the Reserve Bank of India and the \ngovernment of India and failure to obtain this approval could \nnegatively impact our business.\n\u2022 Indian laws limit our ability to raise capital outside India and \nmay limit the ability of others to acquire us, which could \nprevent us from operating our business or entering into a \ntransaction that is in the best interests of our shareholders.\nVIII.

The Chairman and the Company \nSecretary propose the agenda for each meeting, along with \nexplanatory notes, in consultation with the CEO & MD, and \ndistribute these in advance to the directors. Every Board member \ncan suggest the inclusion of additional items in the agenda. \nThe Board meets at least once a quarter to review the quarterly \nresults and other items on the agenda. Additional meetings \nare held when necessary. Independent directors are expected \nto attend at least four quarterly Board meetings and the AGM. \nHowever, with the Board being represented by independent \ndirectors from various parts of the world, it may not be possible \nfor all of them to be physically present at all meetings. Hence, \nwe provide video / teleconferencing facilities to enable their \nparticipation. Committees of the Board usually meet the day \nbefore the Board meeting, or whenever the need arises for \ntransacting business. \nThe Board members are expected to rigorously prepare for, \nattend and participate in Board and applicable committee \nmeetings. Each member is expected to ensure their \nother commitments do not materially interfere with their \nresponsibilities with us.Meeting of independent directors\nFor the Board to exercise free and fair judgment in all matters \nrelated to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board, \nit is important for the independent directors to have meetings \nwithout the presence of the executive management. \nSchedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder \nmandate that the independent directors of the Company shall \nhold at least one meeting in a year, without the attendance of \nnon-independent directors and members of the Management. \nEven before the Companies Act, 2013 came into effect, our \nBoard\u2019s policy mandated periodic meetings attended exclusively \nby the independent directors. \nDuring the year, the independent directors met four times. At \nsuch meetings, the independent directors discuss, among other \nmatters, the performance of the Company and risks faced by \nit, the flow of information to the Board, competition, strategy, \nleadership strengths and weaknesses, governance, compliance, \nBoard movements, succession planning, human resource \nmatters and performance of the executive members of the \nBoard, and the Chairman. \nAlso, the Board\u2019s policy is to have separate meetings regularly \nwith independent directors to update them on all business-\nrelated issues and new initiatives. At such meetings, the executive \ndirectors and other members of the senior management share \npoints of view and leadership thoughts on relevant issues.Men\nWomen75 %\n25 %IndianForeign national62.5 %37.5 %Independent directors75%\nNon-Executive and\nNon-Independent Director\nNandan M.

The Board works with the \nnomination and remuneration committee to lay down the \nevaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the \nBoard, Board committees, and executive / non-executive / \nindependent directors through peer evaluation, excluding the \ndirector being evaluated.\nIndependent directors have three key roles \u2013 governance, control \nand guidance. Some performance indicators, based on which the \nindependent directors are evaluated, include:\n\u2022 The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate \ngovernance practices\n\u2022 The ability to contribute by introducing international best \npractices to address business challenges and risks\n\u2022 Active participation in long-term strategic planning\n\u2022 Commitment to the fulfillment of a director\u2019s obligations and \nfiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board \nand committee meetings.\nTo improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, \nas well as that of each individual director, a formal and rigorous \nBoard review is undertaken on an annual basis. \nThe Board had engaged Egon Zehnder, a leadership advisory \nfirm on board matters, to conduct the Board evaluation for \nfiscal 2022. The evaluation process focused on Board dynamics, \nsofter aspects, committee effectiveness and information flow \nto the Board or its committees, among other matters. The \nmethodology included techniques such as questionnaires, one-\non-one discussions, etc. The recommendations were discussed \nwith the Board and individual feedback was provided. Progress \non recommendations from last year and the current year\u2019s \nrecommendations were discussed. The aspects of succession \nplanning and committee composition were also considered. The \nBoard evaluation process was completed during fiscal 2022.\nFurther, the evaluation process was based on the affirmation \nreceived from the independent directors that they met the \nindependence criteria as required under the Companies Act 2013, \nthe Listing Regulations and the NYSE listing manual.Board and executive leadership compensation\nExecutive leadership compensation\nOur executive compensation programs encourage reward \nfor performance. A significant portion of the executives\u2019 \ntotal rewards is tied to the delivery of long-term corporate \nperformance goals to align with the interest of the shareholders.\nThe nomination and remuneration committee determines \nand recommends to the Board, the compensation payable \nto the directors, key managerial personnel (KMP) and senior \nmanagement. Compensation of directors is approved at the \nshareholders meeting or via postal ballot. Remuneration for the \nexecutive directors and senior management comprises fixed \ncomponent and variable component, including stock incentives, \nwhich are governed by the Infosys stock plans as approved by \nthe shareholders or any other plans as may be amended. The \ncommittee makes a periodic appraisal of the performance of \nexecutive directors based on appropriate performance criteria.\nAs required under the Listing Regulations effective April 1, 2019, \nthe nomination and remuneration committee recommends \nto the Board the payment of remuneration to the senior \nmanagement. The Nomination and Remuneration Policy of the \nCompany is available on our website, at  \nhttps://www.infosys.com/investors/corporate-governance/\ndocuments/nomination-remu neration-policy.pdf.\nNon-executive and non-independent chairman\u2019s \ncompensation \nNandan M. Nilekani, Chairman, voluntarily chose not to receive \nany remuneration for his services rendered to the Company.\nIndependent directors\u2019 compensation\nThe compensation payable to the independent directors is \nlimited to a fixed amount per year as determined and approved \nby the Board, the sum of which does not exceed 1% of net profit \nfor the year, calculated as per the provisions of the Companies \nAct, 2013.

management report\nNote: The risk-related information outlined in this section may not be exhaustive. The discussion may contain statements that are forward-\nlooking in nature. Our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-\nlooking statements. If any of the risks materializes, our business, financial conditions or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. \nOur business, operating results, financial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or \nthat we currently do not believe are material. Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our \nregulatory filings and exercise their own judgment in assessing risks associated with the Company.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables \nthe achievement of the Company\u2019s strategic objectives by \nidentifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and \ngoverning any risk or potential threat to these objectives. While \nthis is the key driver, our values, culture and commitment to \nstakeholders \u2013 employees, customers, investors, regulatory \nbodies, partners and the community around us \u2013 are the \nfoundation for our ERM framework. \nThe systematic and proactive identification of risks, and \nmitigation thereof, enables our organization to boost \nperformance with effective and timely decision-making. \nStrategic decisions are taken after careful consideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential risks and residual \nrisks. The ERM function also enables effective resource allocation \nthrough structured qualitative and quantitative risk impact \nassessment and prioritization based on our risk appetite. Our \nERM framework also enables the identification of underlying \nopportunities during risk assessment, which are then further \nevaluated and actionized by the business. Our ERM framework \nencompasses all of the Company\u2019s risks, such as strategic, \noperational, and legal & compliance risks. Any of these categories \ncan have internal or external dimensions. Hence, appropriate \nrisk indicators are used to identify these risks proactively. We \ntake cognizance of risks faced by our key stakeholders and their \ncumulative impact while framing our risk responses.\nStrategy and strategy execution The risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the \nsuccessful execution of our strategy are covered in this category. For example, risks inherent to our \nindustry and our competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices of target \nmarkets, our market offerings, business model and talent base.\nOperational The risks affecting our policies, procedures, people and systems, thereby impacting service delivery \nor operations, or compromising our core values or business practices are covered in this category. \nFor example, risks such as inefficiencies in internal processes, business activity disruptions due to \nnatural calamities, climate change events, human conflicts, system failures and cybersecurity attacks.\nLegal and compliance The risks arising out of threats posed to our financial, organizational, or reputational standing \nresulting from litigations, non-conformance with laws, regulatory or geo-political developments, \ncodes of conduct and contractual compliances are covered in this category. \nIntegrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework\nWe have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our \nERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique \nbusiness requirements.\u201cDuring the fiscal, businesses around the world, including ours, faced several macro risks such as the continued \nimpact of the pandemic, geo-political events in Eastern Europe, tightening of supply chains, demand for talent \nand inflation.

The risk office played a key role in \nidentifying, assessing and managing primary and secondary \nrisks \u2013 so as to ensure the smooth delivery of services to our \nclients, transparent communication with all stakeholders \nand fulfilling our social responsibility while ensuring \nemployee safety and health.\nThe risk office assessed, monitored and reported on risks \nrelated to strategic programs covering sales, cost optimization, automation, employee engagement and retention. Specifically, \nthese included risks arising from the multiple waves of the \npandemic, readiness for post-pandemic operational resilience, \ngeopolitical and macro-economic events such as the conflict in \nEastern Europe, contractual liabilities, heightened cybersecurity \nthreats, employee attrition and data protection regulations. \nWhile the Company tracks several risks to its business as \nmentioned in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis  section \nof this Integrated Annual Report, the key risks are described \nbelow along with the Company\u2019s approach to mitigate them.\nKey risks Mitigation approach\nAdverse geo-political, economic or health events may impact demand \nfor our offerings and /or technology and talent supply chain.Broad-based growth to reduce concentration in any single region, \nclient or industry, operational agility to assess and respond to \nsituations\nCommoditization of traditional offerings may impact our market share \nand profitability. Investment in launching innovative new offerings, a broad portfolio of \ninterconnected services and solutions, and focused growth of digital \ncapabilities\nTalent attrition beyond acceptable levels may impact our ability to \nstaff projects or optimize cost structures. Employee engagement and care, holistic employee retention and \nrecognition policies, focus on career and leadership development\nCost inflation may impact our cost structure and longer-term \nprofitability.Effective operations with sustainable cost optimization levers, \nautomation and planned capex program\nDisruptive technologies such as cloud, software-as-a-service and \nautomation software may diminish the value of some of our service \nofferings (emerging risk).Robust alliance strategy, consulting and industry-domain-knowledge-\nled solutions, reskilling program for employees into newer \ntechnologies and methodologies, and large deal program \nCyber attacks that breach our information network or failure to \nprotect sensitive information of our stakeholders in accordance with \napplicable laws may impact our operations or result in significant \nregulatory penalties.Robust cybersecurity framework, controls, governance, preparedness \nfor response to incidents, insurance, region-specific data protection \ncontrols and awareness campaigns \nNew regulations or amendments to existing regulations (e.g., \nimmigration, wages, tax, sanctions) may have an adverse impact on \nour operations (emerging risk).Active engagement with policymakers and trade associations, \nwell-governed compliance framework and controls, and de-risked \noperations\nIf our employees operate remotely for extended periods, it may \nadversely impact their productivity, our information security controls \nand the social capital of the organization.Implement a hybrid operational model that balances client \nrequirements, evolving employee preferences, legal requirements and \ninformation security risks\nPhysical disasters or climate change events may adversely impact our \noperations.Well-established and tested business continuity plans, crisis \nmanagement policy, distributed operations, sustainability and \ncommunity engagement initiatives\nCybersecurity risk management\nCyber risks, being one of the key risks, is managed through multi-\nlayered controls with a defense-in-depth approach starting from \nthe thoughtfully-crafted Cybersecurity Strategy, supplemented \nby policies, processes and controls (preventive, detective, and \ncorrective). Our strategy is focussed on four areas: transparency \n& experience, continual improvement & compliance, cyber \nresilience, and building & maintaining a positive cybersecurity \nculture within the organization, thus making cybersecurity a \nsustainable and repeatable process throughout the organization. A high-level working group, the enterprise Information Security \nCouncil (ISC) has been established, which is responsible for \ngoverning and overseeing the Information Security Management \nSystem (ISMS) at Infosys. ISC focuses on establishing, directing, \nmonitoring, and executing the information security program \nwith representation from various departments and business \nunits at Infosys and reports to the Operational Risk Council for \nhighlighting key risks to the executive leadership.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0398ab36-38b3-4436-a982-40671fd277bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "0398ab36-38b3-4436-a982-40671fd277bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eaea63c7-27b7-4132-b098-90d14e3c3334", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "141", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "b67e413b9be4783c344d7cece79b0a3dd8235bf39804bb82869c87778483eee1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bf26f336-d705-4e09-adda-fbe3f9b514df", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "140", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "1af84029fac255360294a1c83b021d2cfe5d748dd9b1a924e053d81b0cc5c534", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "61b4b85e-38c3-44b2-a9aa-acdd71090173", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "94b3dfdd02008c74c6c46b8e2aa49d93628b47593cecf433e44acf37c0d279f8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22174\nIntroduction Delivering \nvalueGovernance BRSRStatutory \nreportsFinancial \nstatements\nCEO and CFO \ncertificationApproaching \nvalue creationStrategy  \nreviewCEO and CFO certification\nThe Board of Directors \nInfosys Limited, Bengaluru\nDear members of the Board,\nWe, Salil Parekh, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, and Nilanjan Roy, Chief Financial Officer of Infosys Limited, to the best of \nour knowledge and belief, certify that:\n1.

The Company derives \nrevenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package \nimplementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company\u2019s core and digital offerings and business \nprocess management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance \nobligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of \nthe customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgment.\nIn certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor \nequipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is \nrecorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the \nCompany is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it controls the products or \nservice before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the \ncontract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and \ntherefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed \nthrough an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method \nwhen the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is \nnot even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of \nmethod to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature \nof the deliverables.\nAs certain contracts with customers involve management\u2019s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, \n(2) determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue \nis recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these \njudgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.\nRefer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the standalone financial statements.\nAuditor\u2019s Response\nPrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the \nCompany is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line \nbasis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, \n(b)\u00a0determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed \nprice maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of \ncompletion method.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:\n \u2013Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents \nthat were part of the agreement.\n \u2013Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management\u2019s conclusions regarding the \n(i)\u00a0identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent \nand (iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of \ncompletion method.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4233, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "278e1ebc-bd83-4a86-9d3a-42853e67862d": {"__data__": {"id_": "278e1ebc-bd83-4a86-9d3a-42853e67862d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "017c0daf-f698-4e77-9b23-1713aa08936f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "145", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "a6fb96c15be3ed330191537d693f8b62abdf639f154853f9bcac435d3ad2387f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2f468e4c-25d0-4c67-94fd-cc5756fbb121", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "144", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "de095294b3175d6acc643adec0413dfe05ee7ff0f3797fb54dd191f0d03592c1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b957a751-07ad-439e-a764-780a027f7477", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f3b09a5729057cafe3b5b5d373aa3d4d1e463c71672893bc193daf8668f6dca4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22178\nIntroduction Delivering \nvalueGovernance BRSRStatutory \nreports\nStandaloneFinancial \nstatementsStrategy  \nreviewApproaching \nvalue creationSr. No. Key Audit Matter\n2 Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through \nan indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the \npattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through \nthe period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, \nfixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-\nof-completion method.\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended \nto date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to \nmeasure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total \nefforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes \nbased on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the \nperiod in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nWe identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage \nof completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment \nand is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. \nThis\u00a0estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred \nto-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the \nterm of the contracts.\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to \nevaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.\nRefer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the standalone financial statements.\nAuditor\u2019s Response\nPrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the \nfollowing, among others:\n\u2022  We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts \nor costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls \npertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of \nefforts incurred.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and \nperformed the following:\n \u2013Evaluated management\u2019s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation \nby comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance \nobligations that have been fulfilled.\n \u2013Compared efforts or costs incurred with Company\u2019s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant \nvariations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs \nor efforts to complete the contract.\n \u2013Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off \nfrom customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts \nto complete the remaining performance

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting \n(the \u201cGuidance Note\u201d) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, \nto the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with \nethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls \nover financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system \nover financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included \nobtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and \ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected \ndepend on the auditor\u2019s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the \nCompany\u2019s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting principles. A company\u2019s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) \npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the \nassets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial \nstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being \nmade only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance \nregarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a \nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper \nmanagement override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any \nevaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial \ncontrol over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the \npolicies or procedures may deteriorate.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5355, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c794b33f-ea0a-45cb-a2d2-8bbfdc985d03": {"__data__": {"id_": "c794b33f-ea0a-45cb-a2d2-8bbfdc985d03", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bc8073a1-92be-4abe-a0a0-27f0ad3a2596", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "150", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "5dc7371661c5a669e84f752237ebeb4448605fb68a1962bf1dacab34e9e5e5d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "bb100172-e6bf-4d2f-bcaf-f9252ffacf1e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "149", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "7c55e2f157e2dad71b7da8b27b01e0990753271162bda9b71d8263149edb46ae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f53efb3f-ccea-4255-a3d1-f50c34257eb4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2c5352225e7fc35b16d35306415377704bad7b649be24626c1f196bc89bbfebf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22183\nIntroduction Delivering \nvalueGovernance BRSRStatutory \nreports\nStandaloneFinancial \nstatementsStrategy  \nreviewApproaching \nvalue creationOpinion\nIn our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material respects, \nan adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were \noperating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the \nCompany considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls \nOver Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI. \nFor DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS LLP\nChartered Accountants\n(Firm\u2019s Registration No. 117366W/W-100018)\nPlace: Bengaluru\nDate: April 13, 2022Sanjiv V.

The Company \nhas its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock \nExchange of India Limited. The Company\u2019s American Depositary \nShares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New \nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE). \nThe Standalone financial statements  are approved for issue by the \nCompany\u2019s Board of Directors on April 13, 2022.\n1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements \nThese Standalone financial statements  are prepared in accordance \nwith Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS), under the historical \ncost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial \ninstruments which are measured at fair values, the provisions of \nthe Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") (to the extent notified) and \nguidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India \n(SEBI). The\u00a0Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act \nread with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) \nRules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued there after. \nAccounting policies have been consistently applied except where \na newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a \nrevision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in \nthe accounting policy hitherto in use.\nAs the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded \nto the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous \nquarters might not always add up to the year end figures \nreported in this statement.\n1.3 Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the Standalone financial statements  in \nconformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make \nestimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, \njudgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting \npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the \ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of \nthe financial statements and reported amounts of revenues \nand expenses during the period. The application of accounting \npolicies that require critical accounting estimates involving \ncomplex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions \nin these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.4. \nAccounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual Overview and notes to the standalone financial statements\nresults could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes \nin estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of \nchanges in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in \nestimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period \nin which changes are made and, if material, their effects are \ndisclosed in the notes to the Standalone financial statements .\nEstimation of uncertainties relating to the global health \npandemic from COVID-19 (\"COVID-19\")\nThe Company has considered the possible effects that may \nresult from COVID-19 in the preparation of these Standalone \nfinancial statements  including the recoverability of carrying \namounts of financial and non-financial assets. In developing \nthe assumptions relating to the possible future uncertainties \nin the global economic conditions because of this pandemic, \nthe Company has, at the date of approval of these financial \nstatements, used internal and external sources of information \nincluding credit reports and related information and economic \nforecasts and expects that the carrying amount of these assets \nwill be recovered. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s \nfinancial statements may differ from that estimated as at the date \nof approval of these Standalone financial statements .\n1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments\na. Revenue recognition \nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers include promises to \ntransfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues \nfrom customer contracts are considered for recognition and \nmeasurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, \nby the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are \ncommitted to perform their respective obligations under the \ncontract, and the contract is legally enforceable.

assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective \nindividual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an \nidentifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other \neconomic factors (such as the stability of the industry, and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures \nrequired to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically \nincluding at each financial year end. \nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and \ncommercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and ability \nto complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of \nmaterial, direct labor, overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. \nThe changes in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2022 are as follows :\nin \u20b9 crore\nParticulars Customer-\nrelatedSoftware-\nrelatedTrade name-\nrelatedOthers Total\nGross carrying value as at April 1, 2021  113  54  26  26  219 \nAdditions through business transfer  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nDeletions during the year  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nGross carrying value as at March 31, 2022  113  54  26  26  219 \nAccumulated amortization as at April 1, 2021  (88)  (12)  (26)  (26)  (152)\nAmortization expense  (16)  (19)  (35)\nAccumulated amortization on deletions  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nAccumulated amortization as at March 31, 2022  (104)  (31)  (26)  (26)  (187)\nCarrying value as at March 31, 2022  9  23  \u2013  \u2013  32 \nCarrying value as at April 1, 2021  25  42  \u2013  \u2013  67 \nEstimated useful life (in years)  7  2  5  5 \nEstimated remaining useful life (in years)  1  1  \u2013  \u2013", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3035, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2198f298-e2ec-4c02-a730-f5b158007f06": {"__data__": {"id_": "2198f298-e2ec-4c02-a730-f5b158007f06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a12b74f7-d982-4b02-805a-e743262f2f85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "94d782e64d074aee35b4bd887d5d1a216c23b02024a7d1ac5e80c410f7a6ba51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "da0bd098-5724-4067-9c40-4c5a47299b07", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "171", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "bb4f1d90501e9dc471e83b735e4996ab75f88f9eb09983986a144e1f47568338", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d03403fe-11f3-4998-8fa8-e9de0497fa6b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "026727c5fc3418f0a322e3afbf2958351726ea515fbf00f2c184aaa8b5509a91", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22205\nIntroduction Delivering \nvalueGovernance BRSRStatutory \nreports\nStandaloneFinancial \nstatementsStrategy  \nreviewApproaching \nvalue creationThe changes in the carrying value of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2021 were as follows :\nin \u20b9 crore\nParticulars Customer-\nrelatedSoftware-\nrelatedTrade name-\nrelatedOthers Total\nGross carrying value as at April 1, 2020  113  \u2013  26  26  165 \nAddition through business transfer  \u2013  54  \u2013  \u2013  54 \nDeletions during the year  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nGross carrying value as at March 31, 2021  113  54  26  26  219 \nAccumulated amortization as at April 1, 2020  (72)  \u2013  (23)  (22)  (117)\nAmortization expense  (16)  (12)  (3)  (4)  (35)\nAccumulated amortization on deletions  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nAccumulated amortization as at March 31, 2021  (88)  (12)  (26)  (26)  (152)\nCarrying value as at March 31, 2021  25  42  \u2013  \u2013  67 \nCarrying value as at April 1, 2020  41  \u2013  3  4  48 \nEstimated useful life (in years)  7  2  5  5 \nEstimated remaining useful life  (in years)  2  2  \u2013  \u2013 \nThe amortization expense has been included under depreciation and amortization expense in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss\nResearch and development expenditure\nResearch and Development expense recognized in net \nprofit in the Statement of Profit and Loss for the years ended \nMarch 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 is \u20b9 529 crore and \u20b9 508 \ncrore, respectively.\n2.3 Leases\nAccounting policy\nThe Company as a lessee\nThe Company\u2019s lease asset classes consist of leases for land, \nbuildings and computers. The Company assesses whether a \ncontract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract \nis, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control \nthe use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange \nfor consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right \nto control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses \nwhether : (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset \n(ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits \nfrom use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the \nCompany has the right to direct the use of the asset. \nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Company \nrecognizes a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease \nliability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except \nfor leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) \nand low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, \nthe Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating \nexpense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \nAs a lessee, the Company determines the lease term as the non-\ncancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend \nor terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably \ncertain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected \nlease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or \nterminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease \nterm, the Company considers factors such as any significant \nleasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs \nrelating to the termination of the lease and the importance \nof the underlying asset to Infosys\u2019s operations taking into \naccount the location of the underlying asset and the availability \nof suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is \nreassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current \neconomic circumstances.\nCertain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or \nterminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets \nand lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably \ncertain that they will be exercised. \nROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises \nthe initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease \npayments made at or prior to the commencement date of \nthe lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4040, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d03403fe-11f3-4998-8fa8-e9de0497fa6b": {"__data__": {"id_": "d03403fe-11f3-4998-8fa8-e9de0497fa6b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a12b74f7-d982-4b02-805a-e743262f2f85", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "94d782e64d074aee35b4bd887d5d1a216c23b02024a7d1ac5e80c410f7a6ba51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2198f298-e2ec-4c02-a730-f5b158007f06", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "484fa3e67c9341b2927cf061eff7f0c9057a722964f3c599fd68bb91cf122a44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c6adbf19-c318-468d-add4-609b16628c20", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2957d69e5cca2e7a7929e8834f7e5ca1f12c58b8ffea8bc9e9026c038237287c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In evaluating the lease \nterm, the Company considers factors such as any significant \nleasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs \nrelating to the termination of the lease and the importance \nof the underlying asset to Infosys\u2019s operations taking into \naccount the location of the underlying asset and the availability \nof suitable alternatives.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognized \nat fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables \nwhich are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction \ncosts that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue \nof financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair \nvalue through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial \nrecognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are \naccounted for at trade date.\n2.11.2 Subsequent measurement\na. Non-derivative financial instruments \n(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost \nif it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold \nthe asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the \ncontractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified \ndates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and \ninterest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(ii) Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive \nincome (FVOCI)\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through \nother comprehensive income if it is held within a business model \nwhose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash \nflows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the \nfinancial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are \nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount \noutstanding. The Company has made an irrevocable election \nfor its investments which are classified as equity instruments \nto present the subsequent changes in fair value in other \ncomprehensive income based on its business model. \n(iii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\nA financial asset which is not classified in any of the above \ncategories are subsequently fair valued through profit or loss. \n(iv) Financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost \nusing the effective interest method, except for contingent \nconsideration recognized in a business combination which is \nsubsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. For \ntrade and other payables maturing within one year from the \nBalance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value \ndue to the short maturity of these instruments.\n(v) Investment in subsidiaries\nInvestment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate \nfinancial statements.\nb. Derivative financial instruments\nThe Company holds derivative financial instruments such as \nforeign exchange forward and options contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. \nThe counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank.\n(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, at fair value \nthrough profit or loss\nThis category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities \nwhich are not designated as hedges.\nAlthough the Company believes that these derivatives \nconstitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may \nnot qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial \nInstruments . Any derivative that is either not designated as \nhedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is \ncategorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value \nthrough profit or loss.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially \nat fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized \nin net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. \nSubsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured \nat fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange \ngains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in \nthis category are presented as current assets / current liabilities \nif they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized \nwithin 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.\n(ii) Cash flow hedge\nThe Company designates certain foreign exchange forward \nand options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate \nthe risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable \nforecast cash transactions. \nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge instrument, \nthe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative \nis recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated \nin the cash flow hedge reserve.

For all other financial assets, \nexpected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to \nthe 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase \nin credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are \nmeasured at lifetime ECL. \nThe Company determines the allowance for credit losses \nbased on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current \nand estimated future economic conditions. The Group \nconsiders current and anticipated future economic conditions \nrelating to industries the Company deals with and the \ncountries where it operates. \nThe amount of ECLs (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss \nallowance at the reporting date to the amount that is required \nto be recognized is recognized as an impairment gain or loss in \nStatement of Profit and Loss.",

set off \ncurrent tax assets against current tax liabilities and where the \ndeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income \ntaxes levied by the same taxation authority.\nIn assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, the \nmanagement considers whether some portion or all of the \ndeferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate \nrealization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon \nthe generation of future taxable income during the periods \nin which the temporary differences become deductible. The \nmanagement considers the scheduled reversals of deferred \nincome tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax \nplanning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level \nof historical taxable income and projections for future taxable \nincome over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets \nare deductible, management believes that the Company will \nrealize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount \nof the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, \ncould be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable \nincome during the carry forward period are reduced.\nThe Company\u2019s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired \nin March 2021. The Company has applied for renewal of APA and \ncurrently the US taxable income is based on the Company\u2019s best \nestimate determined based on the expected value method.\n2.18 Revenue from operations\nAccounting policy\nThe Company derives revenues primarily from IT services \ncomprising software development and related services, \nmaintenance, consulting and package implementation, and \nfrom licensing of software products and platforms across \nthe Company\u2019s core and digital offerings (together called as \n\u201csoftware-related services\u201d). Contracts with customers are \neither on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a \nfixed-timeframe basis.Revenues from customer contracts are considered for \nrecognition and measurement when the contract has been \napproved by the parties, in writing, to the contract, the parties to \ncontract are committed to perform their respective obligations \nunder the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. \nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised \nproducts or services (\u201cperformance obligations\u201d) to customers \nin an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has \nreceived or expects to receive in exchange for these products \nor services (\u201ctransaction price\u201d). When there is uncertainty as \nto collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such \nuncertainty is resolved.\nThe Company assesses the services promised in a contract and \nidentifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. \nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct \nperformance obligation based on the relative standalone selling \nprice. The price that is regularly charged for an item when \nsold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling \nprice. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method \nused to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost \nplus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost \nof satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an \nappropriate margin based on similar services.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts may include variable consideration \nincluding rebates, volume discounts and penalties.

Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts \nare continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and \nare recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates \nchange or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the \nestimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the \ncontract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on \nuncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such \nlosses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs \nto complete the contract.\nThe billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic \nperformance-based billing and / or milestone based progress \nbillings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled \nrevenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as \ncontract liabilities (which we refer to as \"unearned revenues\").\nIn arrangements for software development and related \nservices and maintenance services, by applying the revenue \nrecognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, \nthe arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for \nconsidering software development and related services as distinct \nperformance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the \nCompany measures the revenue in respect of each performance \nobligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The \nprice that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is \nthe best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where \nthe Company is unable to determine the standalone selling price, \nthe Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach in \nestimating the standalone selling price.

These contracts \nare accounted in accordance with such specific accounting \nguidance. In such arrangements where the Company is \nable to determine that hardware and services are distinct \nperformance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these \nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price \nbasis.

Revenue from licenses \nwhere the customer obtains a \u201cright to access\u201d is recognized \nover the access period.\nArrangements to deliver software products generally have \nthree elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical \nServices (ATS). When implementation services are provided in \nconjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license \nand implementation have been identified as two distinct \nseparate performance obligations, the transaction price for \nsuch contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of \nthe contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. \nIn the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, \nthe Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license \nis required to be substantially customized as part of the \nimplementation service the entire arrangement fee for license \nand implementation is considered to be a single performance \nobligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-\nof-completion method as the implementation is performed. \nRevenue from client training, support and other services arising \ndue to the sale of software products is recognized as the \nperformance obligations are satisfied.

These matters are pending before various Appellate Authorities and the management including \nits tax advisors expect that its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial \nposition and results of operations. \nAmount paid to statutory authorities against the tax claims amounted to \u20b9 5,607 crore and \u20b9 5,817 crore as at March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, respectively.\n(2) Capital contracts primarily comprises of commitments for infrastructure facilities and computer equipment\u2019s.2.22 Reconciliation of basic and diluted shares used in \ncomputing earning per share\nAccounting policy\nBasic earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net \nprofit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the \nweighted average number of equity shares outstanding during \nthe period. Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by \ndividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the \nCompany by the weighted average number of equity shares \nconsidered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also \nthe weighted average number of equity shares that could have \nbeen issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity \nshares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the \nproceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at \nfair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity \nshares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted \nas at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. \nDilutive potential equity shares are determined independently \nfor each period presented. \nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity \nshares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for \nany share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by \nthe Board of Directors.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the equity shares used in the \ncomputation of basic and diluted earnings per equity share:\nParticulars Year ended March 31,\n2022 2021\nBasic earnings per equity share \n\u2013 weighted average number of \nequity shares outstanding 4,22,43,39,562 4,25,94,38,950\nEffect of dilutive common \nequivalent shares \u2013 share \noptions outstanding 52,06,766 36,53,564\nDiluted earnings per equity \nshare \u2013 weighted average \nnumber of equity shares and \ncommon equivalent shares \noutstanding 4,22,95,46,328 4,26,30,92,514\nFor the years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, there \nwere no options to purchase equity shares which had an \nanti-dilutive effect.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4609, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e3215df2-c0cc-418c-8f6e-f6a8cafa6ee2": {"__data__": {"id_": "e3215df2-c0cc-418c-8f6e-f6a8cafa6ee2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "14f34025-9975-4357-9f8d-7861abcde903", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "211", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3934f9ecf66e591cd2adc3256c86799bf4ead10b153c8b3ca5232d6fd202b097", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b01d8db5-783b-46c8-8b93-512afe15d558", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "210", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "731405bcfd2a52b85dcc00beb259397ab4392c8e3d1e377ff00677db968f322e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "50e0d01a-05f8-4f4a-9f94-c15871c73411", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c23348fc9b47165fecfcf10b6193d33dc36872736830b6544db80186a297365", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22244\nIntroduction Delivering \nvalueGovernance BRSRStatutory \nreports\nStandaloneFinancial \nstatementsStrategy  \nreviewApproaching \nvalue creationLegal proceedings\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims, which have arisen in the ordinary course of business.

The group derives \nrevenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package \nimplementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group\u2019s core and digital offerings and business \nprocess management services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance \nobligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of \nthe customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.\nIn certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor \nequipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is \nrecorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group \nis the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it controls the products or service before \nit is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory \nrisk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a \nprincipal or an agent.\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through \nan indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the \npattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through \nthe period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize \nthe maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.\nAs certain contracts with customers involve management\u2019s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, \n(2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue \nis recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these \njudgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.\nRefer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAuditor\u2019s Response\nPrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the \nGroup is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis \nor using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) \ndetermination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price \nmaintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion \nmethod.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:\n \u2013Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents \nthat were part of the agreement.\n \u2013Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management\u2019s conclusions regarding the (i) \nidentification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) \nwhether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion \nmethod", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4210, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "abde29eb-a21c-4ce1-a63d-497c7d58e223": {"__data__": {"id_": "abde29eb-a21c-4ce1-a63d-497c7d58e223", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f7a91504-44ad-4390-a99c-d6c6b1cccbad", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "f8cf129a7845e60a3b203c839b5f7474149cf2f44149d6afff8d77b2fba564f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b169efb-b7b1-4acf-9f18-f2ea558f30f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "224", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "697c71b0ae3ebf323282208d6b378e4595f629255ee0f2b9b21af7541f515347", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a17684d0-e08f-4016-a816-c622b118e25d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d7ce3849d8429760c8ef713c529cf07be7c72f9236cf29653b73ff37c2c42f65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22258\nIntroduction Delivering \nvalueGovernance BRSRStatutory \nreports\nConsolidatedFinancial \nstatementsStrategy  \nreviewApproaching \nvalue creationKey Audit Matter\n2 Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method \nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through \nan indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the \npattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the \nperiod of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, \nfixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-\nof-completion method.\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date \nas a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure \nprogress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total efforts \nor costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on \nthe latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in \nwhich such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nWe identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of \ncompletion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and \nis assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This \nestimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred \nto-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the \nterm of the contracts.\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to \nevaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.\nRefer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAuditor\u2019s Response\nPrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the \nfollowing, among others:\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts \nor costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls \npertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of \nefforts incurred.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured using the percentage-of-completion method and \nperformed the following:\n \u2013Evaluated management\u2019s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation \nby comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance \nobligations that have been fulfilled.\n \u2013Compared efforts or costs incurred with Group\u2019s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant \nvariations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs \nor efforts to complete the contract.\n \u2013Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off \nfrom customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts \nto complete the remaining performance obligations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4159, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a17684d0-e08f-4016-a816-c622b118e25d": {"__data__": {"id_": "a17684d0-e08f-4016-a816-c622b118e25d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "17b51dc4-e82f-45a0-9651-8808cf6c743e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "28e6e3670baf47e166bb5c5f05df666ba36279df966e455328076388a2d0a571", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "abde29eb-a21c-4ce1-a63d-497c7d58e223", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "225", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "f8cf129a7845e60a3b203c839b5f7474149cf2f44149d6afff8d77b2fba564f5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1f60d075-3278-4b63-ba81-509a79c4e26b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6b91e9262b3937e859b871c8d0f9f31a769f6609bf9cdef7ac4f061d896a7d4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22259\nIntroduction Delivering \nvalueGovernance BRSRStatutory \nreports\nConsolidatedFinancial \nstatementsStrategy  \nreviewApproaching \nvalue creationInformation Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor\u2019s Report Thereon\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information.

Overview\n1.1 Company overview \nInfosys Limited (\"the Company\" or Infosys) provides \nconsulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation \ndigital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their \ndigital transformation. Infosys' strategic objective is to build a \nsustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of \nclients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and \ngenerating profitable returns for investors. Infosys' strategy is to \nbe a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on \ntheir journey to a digital future. \nInfosys, together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts, is \nhereinafter referred to as \u2018the Group\u2019.\nThe Company is a public limited company incorporated and \ndomiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics City, \nHosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company \nhas its primary listings on the BSE Limited and National Stock \nExchange of India Limited. The Company\u2019s American Depositary \nShares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New \nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE).\nThe Group\u2019s Consolidated financial statements  are approved for \nissue by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on April 13, 2022.\n1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements \nThese Consolidated financial statements  are prepared in \naccordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), under \nthe historical cost convention on the accrual basis, except for \ncertain financial instruments which are measured at fair values, \nthe provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) (to the \nextent notified) and guidelines issued by the Securities and \nExchange Board of India (SEBI). The Ind AS are prescribed under \nSection 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian \nAccounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment \nrules issued thereafter.\nAccounting policies have been consistently applied except where \na newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a \nrevision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in \nthe accounting policy hitherto in use.\nAs the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded \nto the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous \nquarters might not always add up to the year-end figures \nreported in this statement.\n1.3 Basis of consolidation \nInfosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The \nConsolidated financial statements  comprise the financial \nstatements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its \nsubsidiaries, as disclosed in Note 2.25. Control exists when the \nparent has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to \nvariable returns from its involvement with the entity and has \nthe ability to affect those returns by using its power over the \nentity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give \nthe ability to direct relevant activities, those which significantly affect the entity\u2019s returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the \ndate control commences until the date control ceases.\nThe financial statements of the Group companies are \nconsolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances \nand transactions, including unrealized gain / loss from such \ntransactions, are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial \nstatements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies \nin use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent \npart of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries \nthat are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the \nCompany, are excluded.\n1.4 Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity \nwith the Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, \njudgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and \nassumptions affect the application of accounting policies and \nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures \nof contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial \nstatements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses \nduring the period. Application of accounting policies that \nrequire critical accounting estimates involving complex and \nsubjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these \nfinancial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.5. Accounting \nestimates could change from period to period. Actual results \ncould differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in \nestimates are made as the Management becomes aware of \nchanges in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in \nestimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period \nin which changes are made and, if material, their effects are \ndisclosed in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements .", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4950, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aed60765-269f-4ef5-a4fb-0eb393079817": {"__data__": {"id_": "aed60765-269f-4ef5-a4fb-0eb393079817", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "242", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bf2f48d5-8e54-4abf-988f-07a9553cfcc2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "242", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3c68937e3318a2a05a77312ffcb402389ecd05ca99d98bae0f76ebf6eeab429c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b0480e4c-955f-4543-8358-025304a5b562", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "242", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "b9ec1e24a418814cced28a6d443182bbd8c699205029d3cb45d0f307194e6ee3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "10760a03-bbaa-4f4c-99ca-ab9ba421e718", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1bfa5a0c447a754e8ad78d43c16c5e42cd7dca5b284ad9f34d8d754491bf9ba6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These estimates, judgments and \nassumptions affect the application of accounting policies and \nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures \nof contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial \nstatements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses \nduring the period.

The Group \nassesses the services promised in a contract and identifies \ndistinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of \ndistinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables \nand the ability of the customer to benefit independently from \nsuch deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these \ndistinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.\nFixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a \nstraight-line basis when services are performed through an \nindefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. \nRevenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized \nratably using a percentage-of-completion method when the \npattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer \nand the Group\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through \nthe period of the contract because the services are generally \ndiscrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of a method \nto recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment \nand is based on the promises in the contract and nature \nof the deliverables.\nThe Group uses the percentage-of-completion method \nin accounting for other fixed-price contracts. Use of the \npercentage-of-completion method requires the Group to \ndetermine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a \nproportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. \nEfforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress \ntowards completion as there is a direct relationship between \ninput and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs \ninvolves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the \nperiod of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest \navailable information.\nProvisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete contracts \nare recorded in the period in which such losses become probable \nbased on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nb. Income taxes \nThe Company\u2019s two major tax jurisdictions are India and \nthe U S, though the Company also files tax returns in other \noverseas jurisdictions.\nSignificant judgments are involved in determining the provision \nfor income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / \nrecovered for uncertain tax positions.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, the \nManagement considers whether some portion or all of the \ndeferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate \nrealization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon \nthe generation of future taxable income during the periods \nin which the temporary differences become deductible. The \nManagement considers the scheduled reversals of deferred \nincome tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax-\nplanning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level \nof historical taxable income and projections for future taxable \nincome over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets \nare deductible, the Management believes that the Group will \nrealize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount \nof the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, \ncould be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable \nincome during the carry forward period are reduced (Refer to \nNotes 2.17 and 2.24).c. Business combinations and intangible assets\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, \nBusiness Combinations . Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable \nintangible assets and contingent consideration to be fair valued \nin order to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, \nliabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. Estimates \nare required to be made in determining the value of contingent \nconsideration, value of option arrangements and intangible \nassets.

The purchase price \nalso includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. \nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent \nliabilities assumed in a business combination are measured \ninitially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent \nconsideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date \nand changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are \nrecognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\nThe interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially \nmeasured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests\u2019 \nproportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. \nThe choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-\nacquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount \nof non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at \ninitial recognition plus the non-controlling interests\u2019 share of \nsubsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.\nBusiness combinations between entities under common control \nis accounted for at carrying value of the assets and liabilities in \nthe Group\u2019s Consolidated financial statements.\nThe payments related to options issued by the Group over the \nnon-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as \nfinancial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated \npresent value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently \nmeasured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable \nunder the option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. \nIn the event that the option expires unexercised, the \nliability is derecognized.\nTransaction costs that the Group incurs in connection with \na business combination such as finder\u2019s fees, legal fees, due \ndiligence fees, and other professional and consulting fees are \nexpensed as incurred.Proposed acquisition\nOn March 22, 2022, Infosys Consulting Pte.

"Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2021-22278\nIntroduction Delivering \nvalueGovernance BRSRStatutory \nreports\nConsolidatedFinancial \nstatementsStrategy  \nreviewApproaching \nvalue creationGoodwill amounting to \u20b9 520 crore is not tax-deductible. \nGoodwill pertaining to these business combinations is \nallocated to all the operating segments as more fully \ndescribed in Note 2.4.1.\nThe purchase consideration of \u20b9 1,407 crore includes cash of \n\u20b9 1,307 crore and contingent consideration with an estimated fair \nvalue of \u20b9 100 crore as on the date of acquisition.\nAt the acquisition date, the key inputs used in determination \nof the fair value of the contingent consideration are the \nprobabilities assigned towards achievement of financial \ntargets and discount rates ranging from 12% to 13.5%. The \nundiscounted value of the contingent consideration as of March \n31, 2022 was \u20b9 72 crore.\nAdditionally, these acquisitions have retention payouts payable \nto the employees of the acquiree over the next one to two years, \nsubject to their continuous employment with the Group, along \nwith the achievement of financial targets for the respective \nyears. Retention bonus is recognized in employee benefit \nexpenses in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over \nthe period of service.\nFair value of trade receivables acquired is \u20b9 108 crore as of \nacquisition date and as of March 31, 2022, the amount has been \nsubstantially collected.\nThe transaction costs of \u20b9 11 crore related to the acquisition have \nbeen included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \nfor the year ended March 31, 2021.\n2.2 Property, plant and equipment\nAccounting policy\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less \naccumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Costs directly \nattributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, \nplant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the \nManagement. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is \nderived at after determining an estimate of an asset\u2019s expected \nuseful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. \nThe Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over \ntheir estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The \nestimated useful lives of assets are as follows :\nBuildings (1)22\u201325 years\nPlant and machinery (1)(2)5 years\nOffice equipment 5 years\nComputer equipment (1)3\u20135 years\nFurniture and fixtures (1)5 years\nVehicles(1)5 years\nLeasehold improvements Lower of useful life of the asset \nor lease term\n(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the \nuseful lives as given above best represent the period over which the \nManagement expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for these \nassets are different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of \nSchedule II of the Companies Act 2013.\n(2) Includes solar plant with a useful life of 20 years.Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are \nreviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The \nuseful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets \nas well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their \nlife, such as changes in technology.\nAdvances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and \nequipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified \nas capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost \nof assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under \n\u2018Capital work-in-progress\u2019. Subsequent expenditures relating \nto property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is \nprobable that future economic benefits associated with these \nwill flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured \nreliably. Repairs and maintenance costs are recognized in the \nConsolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. The \ncost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from \nthe financial statements upon sale or retirement of the asset and \nthe resultant gains or losses are recognized in the Consolidated \nStatement of Profit and Loss.\nImpairment\nProperty, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their \ncarrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of \nimpairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of \nthe fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined \non an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate \ncash flows that are largely independent of those from other \nassets.

assets\n2.4.1 Goodwill\nAccounting policy\nGoodwill represents the purchase consideration in excess of \nthe Group\u2019s interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, \nliabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity. \nWhen the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and \ncontingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, \nthe fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain \npurchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is \nmeasured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. \nImpairment\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and \nwhenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of \na cash generating unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For \nthe impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups \nof CGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and \nwhich represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored \nfor internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest \nidentifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are \nlargely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or \ngroup of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of \na CGU, including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable \namount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the \nhigher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. \nValue-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected \nto be derived from the CGU. Key assumptions in the cash flow \nprojections are prepared based on current economic conditions \nand includes estimated long-term growth rates, weighted \naverage cost of capital and estimated operating margins.\nTotal impairment loss of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the \ncarrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to \nthe other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying \namount of each asset in the CGU. An impairment loss on goodwill \nis recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \nand is not reversed in the subsequent period.A summary of changes in the carrying amount of goodwill is as \nfollows :\nin \u20b9 crore\nParticulars As at March 31,\n2022 2021\nCarrying value at the beginning  6,079  5,286 \nGoodwill on acquisitions \n(Refer to Note 2.1)  \u2013  758 \nTranslation differences  116  35 \nCarrying value at the end  6,195  6,079 \nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in \na business combination is allocated to the CGU or groups of \nCGUs, which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.

Intangible assets are amortized over their \nrespective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-\nline basis, from the date that they are available for use. The \nestimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based \non a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, \ndemand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the \nstability of the industry and known technological advances), \nand the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain \nthe expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization \nmethods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at \neach financial year end.Research costs are expensed as incurred. Software product \ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred unless technical \nand commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future \neconomic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and \nability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can \nbe measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include \nthe cost of material, direct labour, overhead costs that are directly \nattributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.\nImpairment\nIntangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment \ntesting, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an \nindividual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In \nsuch cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to \nwhich the asset belongs.\nIf such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to \nbe recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \nis measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the \nassets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. \nAn impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of \nProfit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used \nto determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount \nof the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, \nprovided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount \nthat would have been determined (net of any accumulated \namortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the \nasset in prior years.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3510, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cb8a862e-8113-4dc7-a382-e5b5becc01e7": {"__data__": {"id_": "cb8a862e-8113-4dc7-a382-e5b5becc01e7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "249", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e1d2c03d-1a12-43af-850d-270030009c94", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "249", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d5dc8cb537a10a61eb3a4e7a4891a0f4448020fc62ccedc1795210f370087f09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "84e56996-1b69-47b6-8cc8-d617bed74256", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "249", "file_name": "infosys21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 12311347, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c5a4dcd2d12f2d14bff3749fdf0cf28fe0faa99d0726c6c9c42529de581b138b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "225e1f38-7de0-4cfc-bab9-06e0fc666c7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4e5934f5957aa1178cd1cea12b284bdaa44fdcae9c5e0bfaeb0a32cf732f7358", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In \nsuch cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to \nwhich the asset belongs.\nIf such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to \nbe recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \nis measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the \nassets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. \nAn impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of \nProfit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used \nto determine the recoverable amount.

Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are \nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting \nexchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / \nliabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current \nliabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be \nrealized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.\n(ii) Cash flow hedge\nThe Group designates certain foreign exchange forward \nand options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate \nthe risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable \nforecast cash transactions.\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging \ninstrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value \nof the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income \nand accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any \nineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative \nis recognized immediately in the net profit in the Consolidated \nStatement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer \nmeets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting \nis discontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires \nor is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss \non the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging \nreserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in the \ncash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction \noccurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in \nthe cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit \nin the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the \noccurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted \ntransaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount \naccumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net \nprofit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual \nrights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or \nit transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for \nderecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a \nfinancial liability) is derecognized from the Group\u2019s Balance Sheet \nwhen the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or \ncancelled or expires.2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments\nIn determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the \nGroup uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are \nbased on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting \ndate. The methods used to determine fair value include \ndiscounted cash flow analysis, available quoted market prices \nand dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result \nin general approximation of value, and such value may never \nactually be realized.\nRefer to table \u2018Financial instruments by category\u2019 below for the \ndisclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and \nliabilities.

Loss allowance \nfor trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant \nfinancing component is measured at an amount equal to \nlifetime ECL.

The primary market risk to the Group is foreign \nexchange risk. The Group uses derivative financial instruments \nto mitigate foreign exchange-related risk exposures.

The Group \nholds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange \nforward and options contracts to mitigate the risk of changes \nin exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group is \nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk arising on intercompany \ntransaction in foreign currencies. The exchange rate between \nthe Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed \nsubstantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in \nthe future.

Revenues \nand the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as \nthe contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on \nincomplete contracts are recorded in the period in which such \nlosses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs \nto complete the contract.\nThe billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic \nperformance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress \nbillings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled \nrevenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as \ncontract liabilities (which we refer to as \"unearned revenues\").\nIn arrangements for software development and related \nservices and maintenance services, by applying the revenue \nrecognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, \nthe arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria \nfor considering software development and related services as \ndistinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction \nprice, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each \nperformance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone \nselling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item \nwhen sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone \nselling price. In cases where the Group is unable to determine \nthe standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost \nplus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling \nprice. For software development and related services, the \nperformance obligations are satisfied as and when the services \nare rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the \nwork as it progresses.\nCertain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include \nmultiple elements which may be subject to other specific \naccounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts \nare accounted in accordance with such specific accounting \nguidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to \ndetermine that hardware and services are distinct performance \nobligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance \nobligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the \nabsence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected \ncost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone \nselling price. When such arrangements are considered as a \nsingle performance obligation, revenue is recognized over \nthe period and measure of progress is determined based on \npromise in the contract.\nRevenue from licenses where the customer obtains a \u201cright \nto use\u201d the licenses is recognized at the time the license \nis made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses \nwhere the customer obtains a \u201cright to access\u201d is recognized \nover the access period.\nArrangements to deliver software products generally have \nthree elements : License, implementation and Annual Technical \nServices (ATS).When implementation services are provided in \nconjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license \nand implementation have been identified as two distinct \nseparate performance obligations, the transaction price for \nsuch contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of \nthe contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. \nIn the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, \nthe Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in 2.18 Revenue from operations\nAccounting policy\nThe Group derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising \nsoftware development and related services, maintenance, \nconsulting and package implementation, licensing of software \nproducts and platforms across the Group\u2019s core and digital \nofferings (together called as \u201csoftware related services\u201d) \nand business process management services.

Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted \nas at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. \nDilutive potential equity shares are determined independently \nfor each period presented.\nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity \nshares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for \nany share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes \neffected prior to the approval of the financial statements by \nthe Board of Directors.\nA reconciliation of the equity shares used in the computation of \nbasic and diluted earnings per equity share is as follows :\nParticulars Year ended March 31,\n2022 2021\nBasic earnings per equity share \n- weighted average number of \nequity shares outstanding (1) 4,20,95,46,724  4,24,24,16,665 \nEffect of dilutive common \nequivalent shares - share \noptions outstanding  89,78,410  83,15,802 \nDiluted earnings per equity \nshare - weighted average \nnumber of equity shares and \ncommon equivalent shares \noutstanding  4,21,85,25,134 4,25,07,32,467 \n(1)Excludes treasury shares\nFor the years ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021, there \nwere no options to purchase equity shares which had an \nanti-dilutive effect.\n2.24 Contingent liabilities and commitments \nAccounting policy\nContingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past \nevents and whose existence will be confirmed only by the \noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future \nevents not wholly within the control of the entity or a present \nobligation that arises from past events but is not recognized \nbecause it is not probable that an outflow of resources \nembodying economic benefits will be required to settle the \nobligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured \nwith sufficient reliability.in \u20b9 crore\nParticulars As at March 31,\n2022 2021\nContingent liabilities\nClaims against the Group, not \nacknowledged as debts(1) 4,641  4,061 \n[Amount paid to statutory authorities \n\u20b9 6,006 crore (\u20b9 6,105 crore)]\nCommitments\nEstimated amount of contracts \nremaining to be executed on capital \ncontracts and not provided for (net of \nadvances and deposits)(2) 1,245  733 \nOther commitments*  28  42 \n* Uncalled capital pertaining to investments\n(1) As at March 31, 2022, claims against the Group not acknowledged as debts \nin respect of income tax matters amounted to \u20b9 4,001 crore.

The \nGroup\u2019s operations predominantly relate to providing end-to-\nend business solutions to enable clients to enhance business \nperformance. The Chief Operating Decision Maker evaluates \nthe Group\u2019s performance and allocates resources based on an \nanalysis of various performance indicators by business segments. \nAccordingly, information has been presented along business \nsegments. The accounting principles used in the preparation \nof the financial statements are consistently applied to record \nrevenue and expenditure in individual segments, and are as set \nout in the accounting policies.\nBusiness segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in \nFinancial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, \nenterprises in Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, \nenterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, \nenterprises in Communication, Telecom OEM and Media, \nenterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare \nand all other segments. The Financial services reportable \nsegments has been aggregated to include the Financial \nServices operating segment and Finacle operating segment \nbecause of the similarity of the economic characteristics. \nAll other segments represent the operating segments of \nbusinesses in India, Japan, China, Infosys Public Services & other \nenterprises in Public Services.\nRevenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to \nsegments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable to that segment. Revenue for \u2018all other segments\u2019 \nrepresents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and \nrevenue generated from customers located in India, Japan \nand China and other enterprises in Public services. Allocated \nexpenses of segments include expenses incurred for rendering \nservices from the Group\u2019s offshore software development \ncenters and onsite expenses, which are categorized in \nrelation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain \nexpenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form \na significant component of total expenses, are not specifically \nallocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are \nused interchangeably. The Management believes that it is not \npractical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs \nand expenses, and accordingly these expenses are separately \ndisclosed as \u201cunallocated\u201d and adjusted against the total \nincome of the Group.\nAssets and liabilities used in the Group\u2019s business are not \nidentified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used \ninterchangeably between segments. The Management believes \nthat it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures \nrelating to total assets and liabilities since a meaningful \nsegregation of the available data is onerous.\nBusiness segment revenue information is collated based on \nindividual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue \nis otherwise recognized.\nDisclosure of revenue by geographic

Risk assessment also includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous conditions present are identified and prioritized for elimination \nand control. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks. As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are no \nproduct risks but there are those related to the provision of services like ergonomics in work as well as those associated with the operation of utilities and employee commute. \nParticipation and consultation with relevant personnel involved in the activities is ensured during the process of risk assessments.\nRisks are also assessed prior to and post the development of new buildings. Experience from previous projects and current operations are also considered. We continually monitor \nour construction sites where infrastructure is being established.\nMore details on \u201cOccupational Health and Safety\u201d are available our website at  \nhttps://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html .\n10c.

If yes, provide details.\nTaking advantage of unoccupied offices due to employees working from home, retrofit projects on lighting, air conditioning and UPS have been implemented in several \ncritical areas, which, in a normal scenario, would need a shutdown of buildings, inconveniencing employees as well as disrupting operations. Accelerated phase-out of R-22 \nrefrigerant-based air-conditioning units has been initiated for improving energy efficiency and simultaneously, use of units with refrigerants which have zero ODP and low \nGWP , thus enabling reduction of GHG emissions.\nEnergy-efficiency retrofits have helped us reduce connected load by 34.81 MW across Infosys since 2008. Retrofit projects were taken up for the following reasons: resource \nconservation, end-of-life equipment, indoor environment quality improvement, and technology upgrade.\nIn fiscal 2022, our new buildings in Bengaluru, Mysuru, Thiruvananthapuram and Indianapolis were awarded the LEED Platinum certification from the US Green Building \nCouncil. We also received IGBC (Indian Green Building Council) Platinum certification for our buildings in Chennai and Bhubaneswar. With this, we now have 45 projects \nat Infosys with the highest level of green building certification, spanning a total area of 28.61 million sq.ft.

This program ensures seamless continuity of business and utmost safety of employees and organization assets, while continuously meeting client \nexpectations and helping Infosys to be seen as a leader in this area.\nThe BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and continually improving BCMS across \nInfosys and its subsidiaries as per the global BCMS strategy.\nComprehensive business continuity plans are created at three levels covering the business functions, locations and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management \nprogram, the BCMS plans guide our typical response to events, such as catastrophes, natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations. \nThis covers various crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments for functions, locations and accounts which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in \nplace. This has ensured a highly resilient management system that has been continuously validated through tests and exercises, and various incidents, which have been successfully \ntackled without any major business continuity or employee safety impacts. The best example of this has been the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic over the past two \nyears.\nAn efficient business continuity management policy has allowed our Company to maintain status quo as quickly and as cost effectively as possible during disasters and pandemics. \nIt has also helped in minimizing downtime and achieving sustainable improvements in business continuity and regulatory compliance.\n8.

Accordingly, \nalmost 97% of the increase in Salil\u2019s proposed annual remuneration is linked to performance. Under the revised remuneration, Salil\u2019s \nfixed compensation (fixed pay and time-based RSUs) shall constitute less than 15% of this total compensation at target (compared to \n23% under his current terms). Additionally, 70% of Salil\u2019s performance-based compensation is given in the form of RSU or PSU grants and \ntherefore is predicated on the performance of the Company\u2019s share price.\nIt is pertinent to note that Salil will be granted ~2,21,000 PSUs ( `34.75 crore) 7 for the fiscal 2023 performance, which is a similar number \nto the 2,17,200 8 (adjusted for bonus shares) PSUs ( `13 crore) that was granted in his first year of appointment. This vividly reflects the \nsubstantial value accretion to the Company\u2019s share price.\nAll the performance metrics against which the compensation will be paid have been individually outlined below and will align Salil to \nbuild a strong and sustainable business enabling consistent and superior value creation for shareholders. \nIt may be noted that any comparison of CEO salary to the median remuneration of employees of the Company should be seen in the \ncontext of the Company\u2019s strong performance and stock price growth 9. Under the Company\u2019s general pay structure, equity awards \nare only granted to senior employees so that most employees at the Company have fixed compensation that is not at risk. When the \nCompany\u2019s stock price performs well, the equity awards have greater value making such comparison seem larger. Accordingly, the \namounts Salil realized from his equity award have been higher than targeted values.\nRemuneration detail:\n(A) Fixed compensation\n1. Fixed cash compensation:  An annual salary of INR Eight crore (\u20b98,00,00,000) will be payable as remuneration for his services (\u201cthe \nFixed Pay\u201d). The Fixed Pay will be paid monthly in accordance with the Company\u2019s normal payroll practices. Annual increments \nto fixed cash compensation of up to 7% will be determined by the Board or Committee on an annual basis at its sole discretion. \nHowever, while determining the annual increments, the Board or the Committee will consider factors like inflation, general increases \nrecommended for other executives and the business context.\n2. Time-based RSUs: An annual grant of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) covering the Company\u2019s equity shares (\u201cShares\u201d), having a value \nequal to INR Three crore (\u20b93,00,00,000). Each time-based equity grant shall vest in three equal tranches on the first, second, and third \nanniversary of the grant date.\n(B) Variable compensation\n3. Variable cash compensation:  An annual variable pay of INR Seventeen crore (\u20b917,00,00,000) (\u201cVariable Pay\u201d) shall be payable at \nthe end of financial year 2023 and in subsequent years, during the Proposed Term of his appointment, subject to the Company\u2019s \nachievement of certain targets as determined by the Board or its Committee from time to time (the \u201cTarget Variable Pay\u201d). \nThe Variable Pay for a particular financial year shall not exceed 125% of the Target Variable Pay (\u201cMaximum Variable Pay\u201d). The \nachievement targets cover revenue growth, operating margin and such other annual parameters as decided by the Committee. \nAnnual increments to variable cash compensation of up to 7% will be determined by the Board or Committee on an annual basis at \nits sole discretion. However, while determining the annual increments, the Board or the Committee will consider factors like inflation, \ngeneral increases recommended for other executives and the business context.\n4.
