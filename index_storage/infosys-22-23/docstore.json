\ninherently uncertain forces, can \nsignificantly impact the fortunes \nof a business. While this volatility \nhas come to be expected as normal, \nnot every business emerges from it having \ntackled the situation with the same resilience. \nThose that get a head start in preparing and taking \non the challenges are also the ones that come out of the \nuncertainty with the ability to outperform in the recovery.\nThat does not necessarily mean rethinking one\u2019s business \nstrategy, but rather rearticulating it to adapt. It\u2019s really about being judicious where to lean in and where to pull back. In essence, it\u2019s about protecting one\u2019s capability to innovate and propel forward while being deeply disciplined when it comes to operations. Digitally transformed companies have a distinct advantage here. They can drive frictionless business throughout the supply chain, serve customers at lower costs, and avoid resource-intensive IT upgrades, unlike the digitally disadvantaged who may have to wait for economic conditions to improve before they can make progress.\nAdvanced technologies \u2013 especially AI in tandem with \ncloud \u2013 are creating performance opportunities that are reshaping these dynamics in significant ways. They are helping companies to amplify human potential to take on higher value work, boost people productivity and rapidly create business value. From unlocking efficiencies at scale and empowering the ecosystem to accelerating growth, cognitively capable companies are unshackling intelligence from data for experimentation as well as the scale-out of AI to power greater efficacy and create disruptive revenue streams. \nInfosys is taking the AI-first approach to its own \ntransformation. We are bringing the power of AI, analytics, and cloud to accelerate our own enterprise transformation, even as we build incremental value from micro-changes, to improve client service, reimagine business processes, and boost productivity. Nearly 50,000 reusable intelligent services, applied in over 25,000 instances, are amplifying our employees to boost their productivity.\nIt is Infosys Topaz\nTM \u2013 our AI-first services using generative \nAI \u2013 that\u2019s making it all possible.

The placid and the predictable are behind us as each new day brings new inputs and new events that derail the carefully-crafted models we have constructed of the world around us. The cocktail of inflation, interest rates, geopolitics, war, demand volatility, supply chain dislocations, the shift from efficiency to resilience and security, all stirring quickly and without warning, is what\u2019s before us. In any week, we may oscillate from caution to optimism and back to caution based on the news of the\u00a0day. \nSuch times of intense uncertainty, great short-term \npressure, and crunched resources require that companies must become better, more efficient in their ability to be resilient in the present while also securing their future growth. This is easier said than done. The extreme volatility that surrounds us creates so many probable future states, that it simply isn\u2019t prudent for businesses to plan to succeed in any one anticipated future scenario. Instead, we \nneed to develop the flexibility to be able to avoid limiting \nchoices, reduce concentration risk, quickly adapt, and learn to thrive in any new reality. \nThe era of optionality is upon us.Optionality can take various forms. In our IT infrastructure, \nit is the ability to dynamically reconfigure the way we work \u2013 remotely, in office or hybrid. In the area of talent, it is about building and deploying agile learning platforms so that our people can hone their skill sets to match new demand and new technologies. It is about having a digital-first and AI-first business architecture which can be constantly configured. It is finding the right balance between retaining the core of a company and working with partners on others. Optionality must be ingrained in strategy and execution.\nOur CEO, Salil Parekh, and his global leadership team, \nrealized early on the value that advanced digital technologies like AI and cloud, and more recently, generative AI, can bring to imagine and execute for multiple options in the future. They came together as One Infosys to orchestrate teams that lead the charge to continually transform Infosys into an organization that truly realizes human-machine synergies, from fundamentally rethinking organizational design to segmenting cognitive tasks to get the right balance between people, technology, and process. Today, Infosys is steadily progressing towards a future where we don\u2019t just solve immediate business Navigating uncertainty\nNandan M. Nilekani\nChairmanproblems, but continually innovate and architect for challenges that may emerge in the future. We build it for ourselves first, and then, deeply rooted in our own experience, take it widely to our clients. \nThe awesome possibilities of generative AI, we know from \nour own journey to becoming an AI-first enterprise, is not without its risks. The problems of AI hallucination, systemic biases, lack of explainability along with plenty of practical, ethical and intellectual property-related issues remain open and up for debate. We also know, from our experience, that the path to scaling AI enterprise-wide is non-linear. Often, organizations, seeking to mine value from data and AI models, successfully undertake pilots but fail to factor in what it will take to scale value across the whole enterprise. As demands increase, data volumes grow, and complexity rises, companies find themselves unable to surmount the associated challenges and start to question the path to value. Navigating to value-at-scale from AI and retaining the larger strategic vision while breaking down the tasks \ninto sequential small wins, is not always intuitive or simple. \nWith our AI-first strategy, Infosys is guided by that road map. We are also bringing to our global clients the ability to accelerate business value and amplify human potential using AI technologies with Infosys Topaz\nTM.\nThe digital transformation of every industry and every business, over the last several years, has laid the foundation to create optionality as we navigate the way forward. Our clients have always trusted us to assist them not only to make the right digital investments but to safeguard these investments for their future. Today, we are excited by the opportunity and humbled by the responsibility we have to enable them to bring all their digital capabilities together to execute quickly and effectively for now, while developing multiple options to amplify their competitive advantage and market leadership in an uncertain future. Our client relevance has never been so compelling, our investment in employees as continuous and consistent, and our purpose so keen. We are ready to co-create with our clients and our entire ecosystem a flexible future that puts people first and benefits the broader society even as it propels business forward.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5026, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8ab45df9-9647-4520-b9cd-4e05cecf4ba0": {"__data__": {"id_": "8ab45df9-9647-4520-b9cd-4e05cecf4ba0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "163c8141-a711-4ad7-9996-38ca2abdce3f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "daa68e1129500282eb3f323154a2104e0f33d8f582b07771ac831408643d6535", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "efd66ef4-ba7b-4faf-87e5-7f6df59aa586", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "5fd829c3ee6dfb72393beed975a3f3ed93e3db6f4cd987286aa670076469009d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "22f8442e-cb25-45c8-9c57-430576204bf5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce9df33241f3168b9e6c4f89e280562de504b3a46ef20da983ad6a60042d9f3a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We are also bringing to our global clients the ability to accelerate business value and amplify human potential using AI technologies with Infosys Topaz\nTM.\nThe digital transformation of every industry and every business, over the last several years, has laid the foundation to create optionality as we navigate the way forward.

Our attrition reduced for each quarter of the year.\nWith the changing economic environment, we positioned \nour Company to work with clients for their digital transformation as well as their cost efficiency and automation programs, enabling us to support them in two critical areas of interest.\nWe have developed a strong set of capabilities in \ngenerative artificial intelligence to enhance how we enable our clients to derive value. These capabilities are available to all our clients in the form of Infosys Topaz\nTM.\nOur Cobalt capabilities for the cloud continue to resonate with our clients. Our platforms, including Finacle for banks, McCamish for insurance, Equinox for commerce, and Helix for healthcare, are creating strong impact with clients. \nDuring the year, we were recognized by Brand Finance \namong the top three most valuable IT services brands globally.\nWe continue to deepen our engagement with our clients. \nThe number of clients with over US$100 million in revenue for the year was at 40. The number of clients with over US$50 million in revenue for the year was at 75. Our large deal intensity was strong during the year. We had 95 large deals with a value of US$9.8 billion in the year. We see our One Infosys approach helping support our clients by bringing all our capabilities and the strength of our entire employee-base to work for their benefit.\nWe recruited over 50,000 college graduates in the year and \nended the year with over 3,40,000 employees. At the end of the year, 39% of our employees were women.Our learning ecosystem enabled over 5.5 million learning days for our employees during the year. \nLast year we returned US$3.1 billion to our shareholders \u2013 \nUS$1.7 billion as dividend and US$1.4 billion through our share buyback program.\nAt the end of the financial year, we were the leading \ncompany among our peers in total shareholder return over the past five years.\nWe remain committed to the communities we live and \noperate in. With the work of Infosys Foundation, we support a variety of social causes, including creating positive impact in healthcare, education, sustainability, and women empowerment. Our Infosys Springboard initiative continues to help build digital skills by providing free learning programs to millions of people around the world.\nIn the past few quarters, we have seen the global \neconomy dealing with inflation, interest rate increases, and changes in demand environment for companies in various industries. Our strength in digital, cloud, and in automation, along with cost efficiency capabilities have held us in good stead. These will continue to be critical in the evolving economic environment.\nAs I look ahead, given the trust of our clients, the \ndedication of our employees, the strength of our capabilities, our One Infosys approach, and the guidance of our Board, I remain confident of our ability to serve our clients and continue to create impact for them.\nWith my warmest regards,\nSd/-\nBengaluru Salil

"Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23 Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-2338 39Our business contextApproaching value creation\nTechnology is transforming \nbusinesses in every industry around the world in a profound and fundamental way. In fiscal 2023, we saw emerging technologies, like generative AI, 5G, Low Code No Code, shape the future of industries. Responsible business approaches, including embracing ESG, have gained traction. We continued to witness businesses attempting to reimagine their cost structures, increase business resilience and agility, personalize experiences for customers and employees, and launch new and disruptive products and services. Enterprises are leveraging models of the digital era to extend the value of existing investments and, in parallel, transform and future-proof their business. The need for professionals who are highly skilled in both traditional and digital technology areas are driving businesses to build strategic technology and IT partnerships to realize their transformation journeys. \nWe are also in the third wave of \nAI evolution. The first was driven by machine learning, the second by deep learning and the third by foundation models that will enable us to further fine-tune the necessities of specialized domains and tasks.\nThe future of the technology industry \ncontinues to be shaped by the following trends:\n\u2022 Accelerated demand for IT services \nwith digital going mainstream and growth pockets emerging in areas like cloud, AI, cybersecurity, IoT and immersive technologies\n\u2022 Focus on cost takeouts to deal with the uncertain global environment\n\u2022 Greater leverage of general-purpose AI technology\n\u2022 Increase in enterprise spending on hybrid, multi-cloud led transformation\u2022 Proliferation of tech natives and large enterprises responding by reinventing digital business models\n\u2022 Intense competition for talent as enterprises embrace new ways of working amid scarcity of niche digital\u00a0skills \n\u2022 Focus on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) as a strategic theme for all enterprise stakeholders\nIntense competition marks the \ndelivery of traditional services in a rapidly changing marketplace, especially with the emergence of new players in niche technology \nareas. Infosys\u2019 industry expertise, end \nto-end service capability and digital solutions, ability to scale, established platforms, superior quality and process execution, distributed agile global delivery model, experienced management team, talented professionals and track record are often cited as clear differentiators.\nResponsibility and \nresponsiveness\nAs an early proponent of responsible \nbusiness, Infosys has incorporated ESG goals into the entirety of its operations. Infosys ESG Vision 2030 articulates the Company\u2019s ambitions to balance success as a business with unwavering focus on exemplary governance and responsiveness to the needs of stakeholders. Primary stakeholders include investors, customers, employees, suppliers, communities, government and regulatory bodies.

Infosys plans to work with local partners to improve water availability in the communities in which Infosys\u00a0operates. Waste management\nWe seek to uphold our ambition of zero waste to landfills through active minimization combined with technology investment in recycling and streamlining systems and processes.\nWhile there is a constant effort to \nreduce waste generated through the adoption of sustainable practices in operations, the biggest differentiator is the in-campus treatment of all the organic waste (comprising food waste, garden waste and STP sludge), following a true net-zero approach. Organic waste contributes to an average of 75% of the total waste generated at Infosys and effective treatment and reuse has created a circular economy for this stream of waste within our campuses. Infosys\u2019 India centers are heading towards the 2030 target of zero waste to landfills through the adoption of TRUE Certification.\nBiodiversity\nA saga of greening\nA significant and proven way to tackle climate change is to increase green cover by planting trees. Infosys Mangaluru offers a striking example of this, where barren land has been transformed into a lush green campus with thriving biodiversity of flora and fauna. The story of this transformation, along with documentation of the tree species in the campus, was recently published as a book. With this, we hope to inspire corporates, developers, administrators and communities to adopt similar projects at scale. The book will also serve as a repository of the endemic species in the Western Ghats for science aficionados.\nIn the process, we have also set new benchmarks in green building certification. Today, Infosys has about 28.9 million sq.ft. of buildings with highest level of green building certification.\nRenewable energy\nTransition to clean energy is an important step towards emissions avoidance.

Free\u00a0cash \nflow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities \nless capital expenditure, as per the Consolidated Statement \nof Cash Flows prepared under IFRS. Dividend and buyback \ninclude applicable taxes.\nIn line with the Capital Allocation Policy, the Board, at its meeting \nheld on October 13, 2022, approved the buyback of equity \nshares, from the open market route through the Indian stock \nexchanges, amounting to \u20b99,300 crore (Maximum Buyback Size, \nexcluding buyback tax) at a price not exceeding \u20b91,850 per share \n(Maximum Buyback Price), subject to shareholders\u2019 approval. \nThe shareholders approved the proposal of buyback of equity \nshares recommended by the Board of Directors by way of postal \nballot through e-voting and the result of which was declared \non December 3, 2022. \nThe buyback was offered to all equity shareholders of the \nCompany (other than the Promoters, the Promoter Group and \nPersons in Control of the Company) under the open market route \nthrough the stock exchanges.

Executive summary and web link(s) of Impact Assessment reports\nOverview:\nThe Company fulfils its CSR ambitions and initiatives, both through its internal CSR volunteers & groups and through the Infosys \nFoundation \u2013 a not-for-profit entity.\nGiven the scale and impact of the CSR projects, a robust methodology for documenting the objectives and corresponding measurement \ncriteria has been identified and implemented. This document includes:\nKey objectives:\n\u2022 Obtain insights into projects to determine the overall effectiveness and impact;\n\u2022 Use measurable indicators to gauge progress of grantee organizations in meeting their intended milestones and long-term\u00a0goals;\n\u2022 Provide frameworks, metrics and tools for ongoing evaluation, monitoring, and design;\n\u2022 Provide recommendations for decision-making for grants; and\n\u2022 Serve as a guidepost for future projects.\nMethodology:\nResults will be measured through a process-outcome evaluation focused on generating appropriate evidence through four key channels: \n1. Key informant interviews:\nThese are in-depth interviews with individuals who have first-hand knowledge about the projects, the underlying need, the people/\ncommunity served by the project, and the intended use of the grant. These interviews are conducted in two rounds \u2013 prior to the actual \nsite visit and then as a summative exercise to triangulate the nature of the findings.\n2. Site visits:\nThese are in-person visits to the project or program sites and the surrounding communities to gather information based on a checklist of \nprogram milestones. These visits and discussions facilitate the research team to come up with observations, and or draw conclusions.\n3. Secondary data analysis:\nThis is a desk-based analysis of data from grantee organizations on the usage of grant, timelines, and monitoring data using \nmanagement information systems (MIS), photographs, press releases, among others.\n4. End user surveys:\nThese are face-to-face, web-based, or telephone-based interactions with end users or beneficiaries of projects.\nThe data thus gathered from primary and secondary sources is analyzed and triangulated to present a comprehensive assessment of \nproject outcomes and implementation processes. \nThe executive summary includes details of 16 CSR projects considered for impact assessment, conducted by LEAD @ Krea University (1).\n(1) LEAD at Krea University (Leveraging Evidence for Access and Development) is research centre that is part of IFMR (The Institute for Financial Management and \nResearch) Society.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3618, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54a6f0bc-d38b-4e74-b9c0-4d89b9e65de6": {"__data__": {"id_": "54a6f0bc-d38b-4e74-b9c0-4d89b9e65de6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32d5f34e-3976-4e20-a3a1-d1848adbbec9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "acb3cb1bbff6492d6614e32862585ef26d34b6dbdf7d507a144c0163a3f9a3fb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2d0a5a37-4436-461a-81e3-6f3c36eb4559", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "61", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "934c700b4baac87b8f543355349c512899f951bdbbe18c0bd09c0414f68112dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "56543afe-c0bd-4f18-a2f4-e09d3e369e80", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37e26994ea85236ca26ef770eb6ac54b5fd92c58ebb8834a0edc69b8a97e0a37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-2390Executive summary of assessed grants:\nProjects undertaken for impact assessment in the current year cover the broad areas of education, healthcare, destitute care, rural \ndevelopment, and environmental sustainability as described below.

Resource \nconservation initiatives at Infosys have been focused, continuous \nand imbibed in our operations and new infrastructure \ndevelopment. The introduction of highly efficient new \nbuildings, major improvements in current buildings, intelligent \nautomation, water management plans, and waste treatment and \nmanagement projects have greatly reduced our environmental \nimpact. We have been able to expand our business while keeping \nresource intensity low.\nIncreased adoption of renewable energy in our operations has \nhelped avoiding our emissions, and our high-impact carbon \noffset projects have enabled us to offset unavoidable emissions.\nEnergy:  Every new building at Infosys follows the industry \nbest standards and practices for energy efficiency. Improving \nenergy efficiency can not only lower utility bills but also reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions significantly. Our two-pronged \nstrategy of constructing highly efficient new buildings and \noperational excellence in existing buildings has significantly \nminimized the energy intensity. Smart automation continues \nto play a key role in remote operations management and build \nresilience in the system. We strive to exceed expectations by \nestablishing new standards and introducing creative systems into \nour structures, thus conserving energy. \nThe capital investment in energy conservation projects was \n`3\u00a0crore in fiscal 2023.\nThe visit of the G20 delegation (Energy Transition Working \nGroup) to Infosys campus, Bengaluru to witness energy \nconservation techniques deployed on the campus, is a testimony \nto our advocacy efforts beyond our boundary, and positively \nimpacting global climate action. \nRenewable energy:  We have a total capacity of 60 MW of solar PV, \nincluding rooftop and ground-mounted systems. We continue to \npursue green power purchase from third-party power producers \nand engage with power distribution companies for enabling \ngreen tariff. We also work with governments to enable favorable \npolicies for scaling up green power by corporates in India. \nWe\u00a0have also embarked on a journey to source green power for \nsome of our leased international locations.Green buildings:  In fiscal 2023, our leased facility in Pune and our \nbuildings in Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad were awarded \nthe Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) Platnium certification. \nAs part of workplace transformation, buildings with interior \nretrofitting received IGBC\u2019s Green Interiors rating, even though \nthey had already been certified as part of the campus green \ncertification process. We now have 46 projects at Infosys with the \nhighest level of green building certification, spanning a total area \nof 28.9 million sq.ft. \nTransformed workplace:  As part of interior retrofits, several \nbuildings were transformed in fiscal 2023 to improve employee \nexperience and productivity in the new hybrid working \nenvironment. Sustainability has been one of the main principles \nin design, giving importance to materials selection and \nequipment efficiency, among other aspects, so as to make our \nworkplaces employee friendly as well as environment friendly.\nWater management:  Reduce, recycle and reuse of water through \ndemand side measures and implementing efficient technology \nhas enabled freshwater conservation. The state-of-the-art \nsewage treatment plants of tertiary treatment capabilities enable \nzero discharge of wastewater from our campuses.

The Board works with the Nomination \nand Remuneration Committee to lay down the \nevaluation criteria for the performance of the Chairman, the \nBoard, Board committees, and executive / non-executive / \nindependent directors through peer evaluation, excluding the \ndirector being evaluated.\nIndependent directors have three key roles \u2013 governance, control \nand guidance. Some performance indicators, based on which the \nindependent directors are evaluated, include:\n\u2022 The ability to contribute to and monitor our corporate \ngovernance practices\n\u2022 The ability to contribute by introducing international best \npractices to address business challenges and risks\n\u2022 Active participation in long-term strategic planning\n\u2022 Commitment to the fulfillment of a director\u2019s obligations and \nfiduciary responsibilities; these include participation in Board \nand committee meetings.\nTo improve the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, \nas well as that of each individual director, a formal and rigorous \nBoard review is internally undertaken on an annual basis. \nThe Board had engaged Egon Zehnder, a leadership advisory \nfirm on board matters, to conduct the Board evaluation for fiscal \n2023. The evaluation process focused on Board dynamics, softer \naspects, committee effectiveness and information flow to the \nBoard or its committees, among other matters. The methodology \nincluded various techniques such as questionnaires, one-on-\none discussions, etc. The recommendations were discussed \nwith the Board and individual feedback was provided. Progress \non recommendations from last year and the current year\u2019s \nrecommendations were discussed. The aspects of succession \nplanning and committee composition were also considered. The \nBoard evaluation process was completed during fiscal 2023.\nFurther, the evaluation process was based on the affirmation \nreceived from the independent directors that they met the \nindependence criteria as required under the Companies Act \n2013, the Listing Regulations and the NYSE listing manual.Board and executive leadership \ncompensation\nExecutive leadership compensation\nOur executive compensation programs encourage \nreward for performance.

The Board reviews the performance of independent \ndirectors on an annual basis.\nThe Board, while deciding the basis for determining the \ncompensation of the independent directors, takes various things \ninto consideration.

changes, uncertainties in the economy, supply chain constraints, talent \navailability, technology disruption and inflation have impacted businesses across the world during the fiscal \nyear. Our enterprise risk management processes were instrumental in keeping the Company focused on our \nmost important priorities toward all our stakeholders.\u201d\nDeepak Bhalla\nEVP \u2013 Chief Risk Officer\nNote: The risk-related information outlined in this section may not be exhaustive. The discussion may contain statements that are forward looking in \nnature. Our business is subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements. \nIf any of the risks materializes, our business, financial conditions or prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Our business, operating results, \nfinancial performance, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are \nmaterial. Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings and exercise their own \njudgment in assessing risks associated with the Company.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables \nthe achievement of the Company\u2019s strategic objectives by \nidentifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and \ngoverning any risk or potential threat to these objectives. While \nthis is the key driver, our values, culture and commitment to \nstakeholders \u2013 employees; customers; investors; regulatory \nbodies; partners and the community around us \u2013 are the \nfoundation for our ERM framework. The systematic and proactive \nidentification of risks, and mitigation thereof, enables our \norganization to boost performance with effective and timely \ndecision-making. Strategic decisions are taken after careful \nconsideration of primary risks, secondary risks, consequential \nrisks and residual risks. The ERM function also enables effective resource allocation through structured qualitative and \nquantitative risk impact assessment and prioritization based \non our risk appetite. Our ERM framework also enables the \nidentification of underlying opportunities during risk assessment, \nwhich are then further evaluated and actionized by the business. \nOur ERM framework encompasses all of the Company\u2019s risks \n\u2013 strategy and strategy execution; operational; and legal and \ncompliance risks. Any of these categories can have internal or \nexternal dimensions. Hence, appropriate risk indicators are used \nto identify these risks proactively. We take cognizance of risks \nfaced by our key stakeholders and their cumulative impact while \nframing our risk responses.\nStrategy and strategy execution The risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the \nsuccessful execution of our strategy are covered in this category. For example, risks inherent to our \nindustry and our competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices of target \nmarkets, our market offerings, business model and talent base.\nOperational The risks affecting our policies, procedures, people and systems, thereby impacting service delivery \nor operations, or compromising our core values or business practices are covered in this category. \nFor example, risks such as inefficiencies in internal processes, human rights, business activity \ndisruptions due to natural calamities, climate change events, human conflicts, system failures and \ncybersecurity\u00a0attacks.\nLegal and compliance The risks arising out of threats posed to our financial, organizational, or reputational standing \nresulting from litigations, non-conformance with laws, regulatory or geo-political developments, \ncode\u00a0of conduct and contractual compliances are covered in this category.\nIntegrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework\nWe have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our \nERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique \nbusiness requirements.Risk management reportStatutory reports", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4298, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2645dd5-b49f-4c6a-91af-5f46bc7557fe": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2645dd5-b49f-4c6a-91af-5f46bc7557fe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39df35ab-747a-4fcf-bcc5-3316ad7df0e2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "130", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3a9f1701b3d89061e436845e01df2dc35324646f50713a6f65b266817f5a9a2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9925ef9c-9fb9-4c2b-ae67-4329d07b47e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "129", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "62282f2982474e5509ae674902ae6ff682ddf5e784adc408e984f66c6ad2af44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4865cb88-5cca-4ad5-9a7a-b6eec42c3ca2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "61015aa962264335c4d49818b9fd1735c13d923674f8d861160ccda2d6ce24eb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23158Integrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework\nStrategy and\nbusiness objectives\nAligned lines of defense\niGRC platform\nIntelligent risk analytics \u2013 Live EnterpriseValues and\ncultureVision and \nmission \nStrategic and\nstakeholder \ngoals\nDerived\n goals STRATEGY\nRisk-enabled decision-making\nTreatment, mitigation and\ncontrol implementation\nSecondary and consequential\nrisk assessment\nResidual risk assessment\nand decision-making\nAuditing, monitoring\nand reporting\nRisk governance\nand disclosuresRisk management Risk identi/f_ication\nRisk\nassessment\nOpportunityOperationalLegal and compliance\nLevel 1 Risk\nLevel 2 Risk\nLevel 3 Risk\nLevel 4 Risk\nSales\nDelivery\nBusiness enabling function\nLevel 5 RiskStrategy execution\nGranularityType of risks\nImpact groupsPERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nBoard of Directors\nRisk Management\nCommittee (RMC)\nof the Board\nCybersecurity\nSub-Committee\nRisk councils\nO\ufb03ce of\nrisk management\nSub-risk councils\nUnit risk councils\nProject and\naccount risk teams8-layer governanceGOVERNANCE\nSalient features of our Enterprise Risk Management program\nOur ERM program adopts unique methods to identify risks, evaluate potential impact and promote risk awareness \nacross the organization.\nSecondary, consequential and residual risks\nSecondary risks are threats that could impede the mitigation \nof primary risks.

Our HSE Policy enunciates our philosophy and commitment \ntowards the management of key HSE aspects. Our HSEMS is certified to ISO 45001:2018 standard across all India locations in line with our strategy. At overseas locations, we have \nimplemented processes based on legal requirements / internal benchmarks and have also included them in the internal audits cycle. We have established numerous interventions \nto address occupational health-related topics, including emotional well-being, mental health, ergonomics, safety, lifestyle diseases and more. Well-equipped occupational health \ncenters are available in all our campuses in India.

Risk assessment includes quarterly evaluation of incidents that have occurred. Hazardous condition, if any, are identified and prioritized for elimination and \ncontrol. Once the identified hierarchy of controls is implemented, the risk assessment is revisited to assess the residual risks. As Infosys is an IT / ITES company, there are no product \nrisks, but there are those related to the provision of services like ergonomics in work and those associated with the operation of utilities and employee commute. Participation and \nconsultation with relevant personnel involved in the activities is ensured during the risk assessments.\nRisks are also assessed prior to and post the development of new buildings. Experience from previous projects and current operations are also considered. We continually monitor \nour construction sites where infrastructure is being established.\nMore details on Occupational Health and Safety are available on our website at  \nhttps://www.infosys.com/about/corporate-responsibility/social/employee-wellbeing/occupational-health-safety.html .\n10c.

This program ensures seamless continuity of business and utmost safety of employees and organization assets, while continuously meeting client \nexpectations and helping Infosys to be seen as a leader.\nThe BCMS program provides a robust framework for planning, establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and continually improving business \ncontinuity measures across Infosys and its subsidiaries as per the global BCMS strategy.\nComprehensive business continuity plans are created at three levels covering the business functions, locations and accounts. Integrated into our Enterprise Risk Management \nFramework, the BCMS plans guide our typical response to events, such as catastrophes, natural or human-made disasters, which could disrupt or severely constrain our operations. \nThis covers various crisis scenarios as part of detailed risk assessments for functions, locations and accounts which are documented with mitigation plans along with controls put in \nplace. This has ensured a highly resilient management system that has been continuously validated through tests and exercises, and various incidents, which have been successfully \ntackled without any major business continuity or employee safety impacts. The best example of this has been the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic in the last two years.\nAn efficient business continuity management policy has enabled us to maintain the status quo during disasters and pandemics as quickly and as cost-effectively as possible. It\u00a0has \nalso helped to minimize downtime and achieve sustainable improvements in business continuity and regulatory compliance.

The Company derives \nrevenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package \nimplementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company\u2019s core and digital offerings and business \nprocess management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance \nobligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of \nthe customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.\nIn certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor \nequipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is \nrecorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the \nCompany is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it controls the products or \nservice before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the \ncontract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and \ntherefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed \nthrough an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method \nwhen the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is \nnot even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of \nmethod to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature \nof the deliverables.\nAs certain contracts with customers involve management\u2019s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, \n(2) determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue \nis recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these \njudgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.\nRefer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the standalone financial statements.\nAuditor\u2019s Response\nPrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the \nCompany is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line \nbasis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others :\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) \ndetermination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price \nmaintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion \nmethod.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures :\n \u2013Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents \nthat were part of the agreement.\n \u2013Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management\u2019s conclusions regarding the \n(i)\u00a0identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent \nand (iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of \ncompletion method.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4128, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4079ec1-05b8-491f-b723-80bf09413141": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4079ec1-05b8-491f-b723-80bf09413141", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "181", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b402771d-d4ae-49a5-9fec-129d6c7db094", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "181", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "be56cc585a71b9be230e3a8844e73d05d25bab7f8ea5284f4af41566dfdcd9b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "026951d8-e436-40f6-a46f-9c0d652ff620", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "000fe8ed976e78199671ffc246616c992db03144e97e1c437a759ce43e2d0fdd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4a8ccc2b-c61f-451d-a197-1db8b7a358f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f68e6917cc8da5d0d0cfeb9c52085a8214f53c2b2e32415bc7d28210c9a91dc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23209Sr. No. Key Audit Matter\n2 Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through \nan indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when \nthe pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even \nthrough the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other \nfixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the \npercentage-of-completion method.\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended \nto date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to \nmeasure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity. The estimation of total \nefforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes \nbased on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in \nthe period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nWe identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage of \ncompletion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and \nis assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This \nestimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred \nto-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the \nterm of the contracts.\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort to \nevaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.\nRefer Notes 1.4 and 2.18 to the standalone financial statements.\nAuditor\u2019s Response\nPrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts included the \nfollowing, among others :\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts \nor costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls \npertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of \nefforts incurred.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured the using percentage-of-completion method and \nperformed the following :\n \u2013Evaluated management\u2019s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation \nby comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance \nobligations that have been fulfilled.\n \u2013Compared efforts or costs incurred with Company\u2019s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant \nvariations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs \nor efforts to complete the contract. \n \u2013Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign off \nfrom customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts \nto complete the remaining performance obligations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4031, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a8ccc2b-c61f-451d-a197-1db8b7a358f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a8ccc2b-c61f-451d-a197-1db8b7a358f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "182", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9ba14b1a-9a3a-41d4-9c44-9ff942562fce", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "182", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "69e7a8b24d2e49333e57db50aa64c3f0a362ad0fde7bbd8d1b3017e4c00a2f53", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d4079ec1-05b8-491f-b723-80bf09413141", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "181", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "be56cc585a71b9be230e3a8844e73d05d25bab7f8ea5284f4af41566dfdcd9b9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9b4f5555-b181-4d69-8fe4-fe20d00224b4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "40a2421a0452e2e3e4468955fb7f1eeb253e90fea390c5fe96d524b20550394e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23210\nStandalone Financial StatementsInformation Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor\u2019s Report Thereon\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial \nReporting (the \u201cGuidance Note\u201d) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the \nextent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements. Those Standards and the \nGuidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements was established and maintained and if \nsuch controls operated effectively in all material respects.\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference \nto standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone \nfinancial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial \nstatements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of \ninternal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, including the assessment of the \nrisks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the \nCompany\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements .\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls with reference to standalone financial statements \nA company's internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable \nassurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance \nwith generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements \nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly \nreflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as \nnecessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts \nand expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; \nand (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the \ncompany's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Standalone Financial Statements\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper \nmanagement override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of \nany evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the \nrisk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in \nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5614, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92b9efdc-7c1f-416c-8c4c-a717cb267583": {"__data__": {"id_": "92b9efdc-7c1f-416c-8c4c-a717cb267583", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e0c17581-e33c-45d1-ae1f-9e4839607f2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "186", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "004a34e4ac6efbbcb88f3bf61b97cd8e6b0ff39e946e6cf04d434b120c9a39fd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fdfdcff-d04b-487e-84e3-052659464718", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "185", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "ffe385a0fb73dfaa455e708fd0a91e2e5d18afb718bdee2b627898c3b790b1d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3eb2ddca-4ec9-4b76-926d-383723cd72a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6ec1e64706a1d40e46ae1eb6437626a4743c26ad7ce00284dc257af6798bf453", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23214\nStandalone Financial StatementsOpinion\nIn our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material respects, an \nadequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference \nto standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2023, based on the criteria for internal financial control \nwith reference to standalone financial statements established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control \nstated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI. \n For DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS LLP\nChartered Accountants\n(Firm\u2019s Registration No. 117366W/W-100018)\nPlace  : Bengaluru\nDate : April 13, 2023Sanjiv V.

Overview\n1.1 Company overview \nInfosys Limited (\"the Company\" or Infosys) provides \nconsulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation \ndigital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their \ndigital transformation. Infosys' strategic objective is to build a \nsustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of \nclients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and \ngenerating profitable returns for investors. Infosys' strategy is to \nbe a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on \ntheir journey to a digital future.\nThe Company is a public limited company incorporated and \ndomiciled in India, and has its registered office at Electronics City, \nHosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company \nhas its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock \nExchange of India Limited. The Company\u2019s American Depositary \nShares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New \nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE).\nThe Standalone financial statements  are approved for issue by the \nCompany's Board of Directors on April 13, 2023.\n1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements\nThese Standalone financial statements  are prepared in accordance \nwith Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS), under the historical \ncost convention on accrual basis, except for certain financial \ninstruments which are measured at fair values, the provisions \nof the Companies Act, 2013 (''the Act'') and guidelines issued \nby the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The Ind AS \nare prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of \nthe Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and \nrelevant amendment rules issued thereafter.\nAccounting policies have been consistently applied, except \nwhere a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or \na revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in \nthe accounting policy hitherto in use.\nAs the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded \nto the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous \nquarters might not always add up to the year-end figures \nreported in this statement.\n1.3 Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the Standalone financial statements  in \nconformity with Ind AS requires the management to make \nestimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, \njudgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting \npolicies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the \ndisclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of \nthe Standalone financial statements  and reported amounts of \nrevenues and expenses during the period. The application of \naccounting policies that require critical accounting estimates, \nwhich involve complex and subjective judgments and the use of \nassumptions in these financial statements, have been disclosed in Note 1.4. Accounting estimates could change from period \nto period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \nAppropriate changes in estimates are made as management \nbecomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the \nestimates. Changes in estimates and judgements are reflected in \nthe financial statements in the period in which changes are made \nand, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the \nStandalone financial statements .\n1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments\na. Revenue recognition \nThe Company\u2019s contracts with customers include promises to \ntransfer multiple products and services to a customer. Revenues \nfrom customer contracts are considered for recognition and \nmeasurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, \nby the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are \ncommitted to perform their respective obligations under the \ncontract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Company \nassesses the services promised in a contract and identifies \ndistinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of \ndistinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables \nand the ability of the customer to benefit independently from \nsuch deliverables, and allocation of transaction price to these \ndistinct performance obligations involves significant judgment.\nFixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably on a \nstraight-line basis when services are performed through an \nindefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period. \nRevenue from fixed-price maintenance contract is recognized \nratably using a percentage of completion method when the \npattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer \nand the Company's costs to fulfil the contract is not even through \nthe period of the contract because the services are generally \ndiscrete in nature and not repetitive.

The Company considers whether \nit has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory \nrisk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether \nit controls the goods or service and therefore, is acting as a \nprincipal or an agent.\nProvisions for estimated losses, if any, on incomplete \ncontracts are recorded in the period in which such losses \nbecome probable, based on the estimated efforts or costs to \ncomplete the contract.\nb. Income taxes\nThe Company's two major tax jurisdictions are India and the \nUnited States, though the Company also files tax returns in other \noverseas jurisdictions.\nSignificant judgments are involved in determining the \nprovision for income taxes, including amount expected to be \npaid\u00a0/\u00a0recovered for uncertain tax positions.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, \nManagement considers whether some portion or all of the \ndeferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate \nrealization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the \ngeneration of future taxable income during the periods in which \nthe temporary differences become deductible. Management \nconsiders the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax \nliabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning \nstrategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of \nhistorical taxable income and projections for future taxable \nincome over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets \nare deductible, the Management believes that the Company will \nrealize the benefits of those deductible differences.

The cost and related accumulated \ndepreciation are eliminated from the financial statements upon \nsale or retirement of the asset.\nImpairment\nProperty, plant and equipment are evaluated for recoverability \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their \ncarrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of \nimpairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of \nthe fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate \ncash flows that are largely independent of those from other \nassets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for \nthe Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\nIf such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to \nbe recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by \nthe amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the \nestimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss \nis reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been \na change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable \namount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its \nrevised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not \nexceed the carrying amount that would have been determined \n(net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss \nbeen recognized for the asset in prior years.\nThe changes in the carrying value of property, plant and equipment for the year ended March 31, 2023

Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically, \nincluding at each financial year end.\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Software product development costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and \ncommercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, the future economic benefits are probable, the Company has an intention and \nability to complete and use or sell the software, and the costs can be measured reliably.

The Company assesses whether a \ncontract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract \nis, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control \nthe use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange \nfor consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right \nto control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses \nwhether : (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset \n(ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits \nfrom use of the asset through the period of the lease and \n(iii)\u00a0the\u00a0Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Company \nrecognizes a right-of-use asset (\u201cROU\u201d) and a corresponding lease \nliability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except \nfor leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) \nand low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, \nthe Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating \nexpense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nAs a lessee, the Company determines the lease term as the  \nnon-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option \nto extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is \nreasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on \nthe expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to \nextend or terminate the contract will be exercised.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognized \nat fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables \nwhich are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction \ncosts that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue \nof financial assets and financial liabilities, which are not at fair \nvalue through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial \nrecognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are \naccounted for at trade date.\n2.11.2 Subsequent measurement\na. Non-derivative financial instruments\n(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost  \nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost \nif it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold \nthe asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the \ncontractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified \ndates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and \ninterest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(ii) Financial assets carried at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income (FVOCI)\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through \nother comprehensive income if it is held within a business model \nwhose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash \nflows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the \nfinancial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are \nsolely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount \noutstanding. The Company has made an irrevocable election \nfor its investments which are classified as equity instruments \nto present the subsequent changes in fair value in other \ncomprehensive income based on its business model.\n(iii) Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss\nA financial asset, which is not categorized in any of the above \ncategories, is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.\n(iv) Financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost \nusing the effective interest method, except for contingent \nconsideration recognized in a business combination, which \nis subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. \nFor\u00a0trade and other payables maturing within one year from the \nBalance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value \ndue to the short maturity of these instruments.\n(v) Investment in subsidiaries\nInvestment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate \nfinancial statements.\nb. Derivative financial instruments\nThe Company holds derivative financial instruments, such as \nforeign exchange forward and option contracts, to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. \nThe counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.\n(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value \nthrough profit or loss.\nThis category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities \nwhich are not designated as hedges.\nAlthough the Company believes that these derivatives constitute \nhedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify \nfor hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial\u00a0Instruments . \nAny derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or \nis so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is \ncategorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value \nthrough profit or loss.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially \nat fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized \nin net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. \nSubsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured \nat fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange \ngains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in \nthis category are presented as current assets / current liabilities \nif they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized \nwithin 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.\n(ii) Cash flow hedge\nThe Company designates certain foreign exchange forward \nand options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate \nthe risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable \nforecasted cash transactions.\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge instrument, \nthe effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative \nis recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated \nin the cash flow hedge reserve.

The amount of the deferred income tax \nassets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the \nnear term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry \nforward period are reduced.\nThe Company\u2019s Advanced Pricing Arrangement (APA) with the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) for US branch income tax expired \nin March 2021.

Contracts with \ncustomers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-\nprice or on a fixed-timeframe basis.\nRevenues from customer contracts are considered for \nrecognition and measurement when the contract has been \napproved in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties \nhave committed to perform their obligations under the contract \nand the contract is legally enforceable. Revenue is recognized \nupon transfer of control of promised products or services \n('performance obligations') to customers in an amount that \nreflects the consideration the Company has received or expects \nto receive in exchange for these products or services ('transaction \nprice'). When there is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue \nrecognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\nThe Company assesses the services promised in a contract and \nidentifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. \nThe Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct \nperformance obligation based on the relative standalone selling \nprice. The price that is regularly charged for an item, when \nsold separately, is the best evidence of its standalone selling \nprice. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method \nused to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost \nplus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost \nof satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an \nappropriate margin based on similar services.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4448, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c70077b-a2ab-4165-b4ae-578f10972fd8": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c70077b-a2ab-4165-b4ae-578f10972fd8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "240", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9f57d787-0fb0-4894-98f4-4a329d1c1976", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "240", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "b349e19611a9a4772c054d1365269ff29d7d83e9b38d84939850ab23daa0ce17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "69b5f032-065e-4f24-aafa-3f28f981f7fd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "239", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "01d3aaa991bf08cae99f01dad18f18b009ca56ef6a1ea88cc047f305f2832724", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cc0523ec-5c30-43d0-aa61-bdbc91f10d8b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "be4b58029c1fb14484a1fd62247acb1d98e7c6964d70d4f3460b9e5076c7f632", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23268\nStandalone Financial StatementsThe Company\u2019s contracts may include variable consideration \nincluding rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The\u00a0Company \nincludes variable consideration as part of transaction price \nwhen there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of \nthe variable consideration and when it is probable that a \nsignificant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will \nnot occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable \nconsideration is resolved.\nRevenue on time-and-material and unit-of-work-based contracts, \nare recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price \nmaintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-\nline basis, when services are performed through an indefinite \nnumber of repetitive acts over a specified period, or ratably \nusing a percentage of completion method when the pattern \nof benefits from the services rendered to the customer and \nCompany\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the \nperiod of contract because the services are generally discrete \nin nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, \nfixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations \nare satisfied over time, is recognized using the percentage-\nof-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to \ndetermine progress towards completion as there is a direct \nrelationship between input and productivity. Progress towards \ncompletion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to \ndate (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs \nor efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts \nare continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and \nare recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates \nchange or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the \nestimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the \ncontract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any, on \nincomplete contracts, are recorded in the period in which such \nlosses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs \nto complete the contract.\nThe billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic \nperformance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress \nbillings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled \nrevenues, while billing in excess of revenues is classified as \ncontract liabilities (which we refer to as \"unearned revenues\").\nIn arrangements for software development and related services \nand maintenance services, the revenue recognition criteria \nfor each distinct performance obligation is applied and the \narrangements with customers generally meet this criteria for \nconsidering software development and related service as \ndistinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction \nprice, the Company measures the revenue in respect of each \nperformance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone \nselling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when \nsold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling \nprice. In\u00a0cases where the Company is unable to determine the \nstandalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost \nplus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling \nprice. For software development and related services, the \nperformance obligations are satisfied as and when the services \nare rendered, since the customer generally obtains control of the \nwork as it progresses.Certain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include \nmultiple elements which may be subject to other specific \naccounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts \nare accounted in accordance with such specific accounting \nguidance. In such arrangements where the Company is \nable to determine that hardware and services are distinct \nperformance obligations, it allocates the consideration to these \nperformance obligations on a relative standalone selling price \nbasis. In the absence of standalone selling price, the Company \nuses the expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating \nthe standalone selling price.

The group derives \nrevenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package \nimplementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group\u2019s core and digital offerings and business \nprocess management services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance \nobligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of \nthe customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.\nIn certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party vendor \nequipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is \nrecorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group \nis the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it controls the products or service before \nit is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory \nrisk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a \nprincipal or an agent.\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed through \nan indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the \npattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through \nthe period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize \nthe maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.\nAs certain contracts with customers involve management\u2019s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance obligations, \n(2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue \nis recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these \njudgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort. \nRefer Notes 1.5 and 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAuditor\u2019s Response\nPrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of whether the \nGroup is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis \nor using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) \ndetermination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price \nmaintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion \nmethod.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:\n \u2013Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents \nthat were part of the agreement.\n \u2013Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management\u2019s conclusions regarding the (i) \nidentification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and \n(iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of \ncompletion \u00a0method.Consolidated Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4104, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1c155e91-07e3-4bdc-bfe0-d5d9b7ea72e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "1c155e91-07e3-4bdc-bfe0-d5d9b7ea72e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "bc1f0ce2-d37e-491d-b404-d21b7878b68d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "265", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "118bd59626e00663af23684aa8c5de953c2ef8893ef6c46454f8044a7802a7b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "80041d7b-41ef-4258-bff0-b2fc104022e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "264", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "88d6f2e3c8833a42e4812a67082380b31717272e3e15d2f3ac42627d3eecb59f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ca66a724-738b-4ab6-847c-288148318be7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f137b47187d67225bba8d047ae7c370d68dc62eb23964e0a786232fe60e8da1f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Infosys Integrated Annual Report 2022-23293Sr. No. Key Audit Matter\n2 Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method \nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed through \nan indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the \npattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the \nperiod of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, \nfixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-\nof-completion method.\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date \nas a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure \nprogress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity.

Overview\n1.1 Company overview\nInfosys Limited (\"the Company\" or Infosys) provides \nconsulting, technology, outsourcing and next-generation \ndigital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their \ndigital transformation. Infosys' strategic objective is to build a \nsustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of \nclients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and \ngenerating profitable returns for investors. Infosys' strategy is to \nbe a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on \ntheir journey to a digital future.\nInfosys together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts is \nhereinafter referred to as 'the Group'.\nThe Company is a public limited company incorporated and \ndomiciled in India, and has its registered office at Electronics city, \nHosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The Company \nhas its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock \nExchange of India Limited. The Company\u2019s American Depositary \nShares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New \nYork Stock Exchange (NYSE).\nThe Group's Consolidated financial statements  are approved for \nissue by the Company's Board of Directors on April 13, 2023.\n1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements\nThese Consolidated financial statements  are prepared in \naccordance with the Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS), under \nthe historical cost convention on accrual basis, except for certain \nfinancial instruments which are measured at fair values, the \nprovisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") and guidelines \nissued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). \nThe\u00a0Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with \nRule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, \n2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter.\nAccounting policies have been consistently applied, except \nwhere a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or \na revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in \nthe accounting policy hitherto in use.\nAs the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded \nto the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous \nquarters might not always add up to the year-end figures \nreported in this statement.\n1.3 Basis of consolidation\nInfosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. \nThe\u00a0 Consolidated financial statements  comprise the financial \nstatements of the Company, its controlled trusts and its \nsubsidiaries. Control exists when the parent has power over \nthe entity, is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its \ninvolvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those \nreturns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated \nthrough existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant \nactivities, those which significantly affect the entity's returns. \nSubsidiaries are consolidated from the date control commences \nuntil the date control ceases.The financial statements of the Group companies are \nconsolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances \nand transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such \ntransactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial \nstatements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies \nin use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent \npart of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries \nthat are not, directly or indirectly, owned or controlled by the \nCompany, are excluded.\n1.4 Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity \nwith Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, \njudgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and \nassumptions affect the application of accounting policies and \nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures \nof contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial \nstatements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses \nduring the period. The application of accounting policies that \nrequire critical accounting estimates, which involve complex \nand subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in \nthese financial statements, have been disclosed in Note 1.5. \nAccounting estimates could change from period to period. \nActual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate \nchanges in estimates are made as the Management becomes \naware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. \nChanges in estimates and judgments are reflected in the \nfinancial statements in the period in which changes are made \nand, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the \nConsolidated financial statements .\n1.5 Critical accounting estimates and judgments\na.

Revenues \nfrom customer contracts are considered for recognition and \nmeasurement when the contract has been approved, in \nwriting, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract \nare committed to perform their respective obligations under \nthe contract, and the contract is legally enforceable.

Use of the \npercentage-of-completion method requires the Group to \ndetermine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a \nproportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. \nEfforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress \ntowards completion as there is a direct relationship between \ninput and productivity. The estimation of total efforts or costs \ninvolves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the \nperiod of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest \navailable information.\nContracts with customers includes subcontractor services or \nthird-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated \nservices arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue \nfrom sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded \nnet of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the \ncustomer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the \nprincipal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates \nwhether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to \nthe customer.

Notes to the Consolidated financial statements\n2.1 Business combinations\nAccounting policy\nBusiness combinations have been accounted for using the \nacquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, \nBusiness Combinations .\nThe purchase price in an acquisition is measured at the fair value \nof the assets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities \nincurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is the date \non which control is transferred to the Group. The purchase price \nalso includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. \nIdentifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent \nliabilities assumed in a business combination are measured \ninitially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent \nconsideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date \nand changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are \nrecognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\nThe interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially \nmeasured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests\u2019 \nproportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. \nThe choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-\nacquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount \nof non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at \ninitial recognition plus the non-controlling interests\u2019 share of \nsubsequent changes in equity of subsidiaries.\nBusiness combinations between entities under common \ncontrol is accounted for at carrying value of the assets \nacquired and liabilities assumed in the Group's consolidated \nfinancial statements.\nThe payments related to options issued by the Group over the \nnon-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as \nfinancial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated \npresent value of gross obligations. Such options are subsequently \nmeasured at fair value in order to reflect the amount payable \nunder the option at the date at which it becomes exercisable. \nIn the event that the option expires unexercised, the \nliability is derecognized.Acquisition\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2023, the Group, completed two \nbusiness combinations to complement its digital offerings by \nacquiring 100% voting interests in:\n(i) oddity GmbH, oddity group services GmbH, oddity space \nGmbH, oddity jungle GmbH, oddity code GmbH and oddity \nwaves GmbH (collectively known as oddity), a Germany-\nbased digital marketing, experience, and commerce \nagencies on April 20, 2022.\n(ii) BASE life science A/S, a consulting and technology firm in the \nlife science industry in Europe on September 1, 2022.\nThese acquisitions are expected to strengthen the Group\u2019s \ncreative, branding and experience design capabilities and \naugment the Group\u2019s life sciences expertise, scales its digital \ntransformation capabilities with cloud-based industry solutions \nand expand its presence across Europe.\nThe purchase price allocated to assets acquired and liabilities \nassumed based upon determination of fair values at the dates of \nacquisition is as follows :\n(In \u20b9 crore)\nParticulars Acquiree\u2019s\ncarrying\namountFair value \nadjustmentsPurchase \nprice \nallocated\nNet assets(1) 103  \u2013  103\nIntangible assets \u2013    \nCustomer contracts \nand relationships  \u2013  274  274\nVendor relationships  \u2013  30  30\nBrand  \u2013  24  24\nDeferred tax \nliabilities on \nintangible assets  \u2013  (80)  (80)\nTotal 103 248 351\nGoodwill   630\nTotal purchase price   981\n(1) Includes cash and cash equivalents acquired of \u20b926 crore.\nThe excess of the purchase consideration paid over the fair value \nof assets acquired has been attributed to goodwill.

Costs directly \nattributable to acquisition are capitalized until the property, \nplant and equipment are ready for use, as intended by the \nManagement. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is \nderived at after determining an estimate of an asset\u2019s expected \nuseful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. \nThe Group depreciates property, plant and equipment over \ntheir estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. \nThe\u00a0estimated useful lives of assets are as follows :\nBuildings (1)22-25 years\nPlant and machinery (1)(2)5 years\nOffice equipment 5 years\nComputer equipment (1)3-5 years\nFurniture and fixtures (1)5 years\nVehicles (1)5 years\nLeasehold improvements Lower of useful life of the asset \nor lease term\n(1) Based on technical evaluation, the Management believes that the \nuseful lives, as given above, best represent the period over which the \nManagement expects to use these assets. Hence, the useful lives for \nthese assets is different from the useful lives as prescribed under Part C of \nSchedule II of the Companies Act 2013\n(2) Includes solar plant with a useful life of 25 yearsDepreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are \nreviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. \nThe\u00a0useful lives are based on historical experience with similar \nassets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact \ntheir life, such as changes in technology.\nAdvances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and \nequipment outstanding at each Balance Sheet date is classified \nas capital advances under other non-current assets and the cost \nof assets not ready to use before such date are disclosed under \n\u2018Capital work-in-progress\u2019. Subsequent expenditures relating \nto property, plant and equipment is capitalized only when it is \nprobable that future economic benefits associated with these \nwill flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured \nreliably.

consideration in excess of \nthe Group's interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, \nliabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity. \nWhen the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and \ncontingent liabilities acquired exceeds purchase consideration, \nthe fair value of net assets acquired is reassessed and the bargain \npurchase gain is recognized in capital reserve. Goodwill is \nmeasured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\nImpairment\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and \nwhenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a \nCash Generating Unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For \nthe impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups \nof CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and \nwhich represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored \nfor internal management purposes. A CGU is the smallest \nidentifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are \nlargely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or \ngroup of assets. Impairment occurs when the carrying amount of \na CGU including the goodwill, exceeds the estimated recoverable \namount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the \nhigher of its fair value less cost to sell and its value-in-use. \nValue-in-use is the present value of future cash flows expected \nto be derived from the CGU.

The fair value of a CGU is \ndetermined based on the market capitalization. Value-in-use \nis determined based on discounted future cash flows. The key \nassumptions used for the calculations are as follows :\n(In %)\nParticulars As at March 31, \n2023 2022\nLong-term growth rate 8-10 8-10\nOperating margins 19-21 19-21\nDiscount rate 13 12\nThe above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average Cost \nof Capital (WACC) of the Company. As at March 31, 2023, the \nestimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying \namount. Reasonable sensitivities in key assumptions is unlikely to \ncause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of \nthe cash generating units.\n2.4.2 Other intangible assets\nAccounting policy\nIntangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization \nand impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their \nrespective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line \nbasis, from the date that they are available for use. The\u00a0estimated \nuseful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a \nnumber of factors, including the effects of obsolescence, \ndemand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the \nstability of the industry, and known technological advances) and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain \nthe expected future cash flows from the asset. Amortization \nmethods and useful lives are reviewed periodically, including at \neach financial year end.\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Software product \ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred unless technical \nand commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future \neconomic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and \nability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can \nbe measured reliably. The costs which can be capitalized include \nthe cost of material, direct labor, and overhead costs that are \ndirectly attributable to prepare the asset for its intended use.\nImpairment\nIntangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment \ntesting, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an \nindividual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. \nIn\u00a0such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU \nto which the asset belongs.\nIf such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to \nbe recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \nis measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the \nassets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. \nAn impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of \nProfit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used \nto determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount \nof the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, \nprovided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount \nthat would have been determined (net of any accumulated \namortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the \nasset in prior years.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3545, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5785bd8e-325c-4e1e-a394-7e00f8581beb": {"__data__": {"id_": "5785bd8e-325c-4e1e-a394-7e00f8581beb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "289", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "702c2c6d-29b8-4978-ac97-b30759ceeffc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "289", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "9e13c5eb212be5735538637e5e62b47e103b9324f795d5b325b0f794de588471", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2183c43f-8256-4262-bb69-08182bdf4b9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "289", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "790f9f090ec9342eb3e5ed9dd3786f45aa8c1a45307de88ab89f84d1df24f661", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4cea2263-5a25-4471-a9a0-ee95ecfe7aad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a294dd2d7584d86a2b1c7e93310f150389e24894578d8a5ce14067fd5cf6c826", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "In\u00a0such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU \nto which the asset belongs.\nIf such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to \nbe recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss \nis measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the \nassets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. \nAn impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of \nProfit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used \nto determine the recoverable amount.

Derivative financial instruments\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments, such as foreign \nexchange forward and option contracts, to mitigate the risk \nof changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. \nThe\u00a0counterparty for such contracts is generally a bank.\n(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, carried at fair value \nthrough profit or loss.\nThis category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities \nwhich are not designated as hedges.\nAlthough the Group believes that these derivatives constitute \nhedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify \nfor hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments.  \nAny derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or \nis so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is \ncategorized as a financial asset or financial liability, at fair value \nthrough profit or loss.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially at \nfair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in \nnet profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when \nincurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are \nmeasured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting \nexchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / \nliabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current \nliabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be \nrealized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.\n(ii) Cash flow hedge\nThe Group designates certain foreign exchange forward \nand options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate \nthe risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable \nforecasted cash transactions\nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging \ninstrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of \nthe derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and \naccumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. Any\u00a0ineffective \nportion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized \nimmediately in the net profit in the Consolidated Statement \nof Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets \nthe criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is \ndiscontinued prospectively. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss \non the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedging \nreserve, till the period the hedge was effective, remains in \ncash flow hedging reserve until the forecasted transaction \noccurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in \nthe cash flow hedging reserve is transferred to the net profit \nin the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss upon the \noccurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted \ntransaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount \naccumulated in cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to net \nprofit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n2.11.3 Derecognition of financial instruments\nThe Group derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual \nrights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or \nit transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for \nderecognition under Ind AS 109. A financial liability (or a part of a \nfinancial liability) is derecognized from the Group's Balance Sheet \nwhen the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or \ncancelled or expires.\n2.11.4 Fair value of financial instruments\nIn determining the fair value of its financial instruments, the \nGroup uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based \non market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. \nThe methods used to determine fair value include discounted \ncash flow analysis, option pricing model, market multiples, \navailable quoted market prices and dealer quotes.

The Group \nholds derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange \nforward and option contracts, to mitigate the risk of changes \nin exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The Group is \nalso exposed to foreign exchange risk arising on intercompany \ntransaction in foreign currencies. The exchange rate between \nthe Indian rupee and foreign currencies has changed \nsubstantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in \nthe future.

Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-\nmaterial, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.\nRevenues from customer contracts are considered for \nrecognition and measurement when the contract has been \napproved in writing by the parties, to the contract, the parties to \ncontract are committed to perform their respective obligations \nunder the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. \nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised \nproducts or services (\u201cperformance obligations\u201d) to customers \nin an amount that reflects the consideration the Group has \nreceived or expects to receive in exchange for these products \nor services (\u201ctransaction price\u201d). When there is uncertainty as \nto collectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such \nuncertainty is resolved.\nThe Group assesses the services promised in a contract and \nidentifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. \nThe Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling \nprice. The price that is regularly charged for an item, when sold \nseparately, is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. \nIn the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to \nestimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a \nmargin, under which the Group estimates the cost of satisfying \nthe performance obligation and then adds an appropriate \nmargin based on similar services.\nThe Group\u2019s contracts may include variable consideration \nincluding rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The Group \nincludes variable consideration as part of transaction price \nwhen there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of \nthe variable consideration and when it is probable that a \nsignificant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will \nnot occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable \nconsideration is resolved.\nRevenue on time-and-material and unit-of-work-based contracts, \nare recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price \nmaintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-\nline basis, when services are performed through an indefinite \nnumber of repetitive acts over a specified period, or ratably \nusing a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern \nof benefits from the services rendered to the customer and \nthe Group\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the \nperiod of contract because the services are generally discrete \nin nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, \nfixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations \nare satisfied over time, is recognized using the percentage-\nof-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to \ndetermine progress towards completion as there is a direct \nrelationship between input and productivity.

For software development and related services, the \nperformance obligations are satisfied as and when the services \nare rendered, since the customer generally obtains control of the \nwork as it progresses.\nCertain cloud and infrastructure services contracts include \nmultiple elements which may be subject to other specific \naccounting guidance, such as leasing guidance. These contracts \nare accounted in accordance with such specific accounting \nguidance. In such arrangements where the Group is able to \ndetermine that hardware and services are distinct performance \nobligations, it allocates the consideration to these performance \nobligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. In the \nabsence of standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected \ncost-plus margin approach in estimating the standalone \nselling price. When such arrangements are considered as a \nsingle performance obligation, revenue is recognized over \nthe period and measure of progress is determined based on \npromise in the contract.\nRevenue from licenses where the customer obtains a \u201cright \nto use\u201d the licenses is recognized at the time the license \nare made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses \nwhere the customer obtains a \u201cright to access\u201d is recognized \nover the access period.\nArrangements to deliver software products generally have \nthree elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical \nServices (ATS). When implementation services are provided in \nconjunction with the licensing arrangement, and the license \nand implementation have been identified as two distinct \nseparate performance obligations, the transaction price for \nsuch contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of \nthe contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. \nIn the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, \nthe Group uses the expected cost-plus-margin approach in \nestimating the standalone selling price. Where the license \nis required to be substantially customized as part of the \nimplementation service, the entire arrangement fee for license \nand implementation is considered to be a single performance \nobligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-\nof-completion method while the implementation is performed. \nRevenue from client training, support and other services arising \ndue to the sale of software products is recognized as the \nperformance obligations are satisfied. ATS revenue is recognized \nratably on a straight-line basis over the period in which the \nservices are rendered.\nContracts with customers includes subcontractor services or \nthird-party vendor equipment or software in certain integrated \nservices arrangements. In these types of arrangements, revenue \nfrom sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded \nnet of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the \nprincipal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates \nwhether it controls the good or service before it is transferred to \nthe customer. The Group considers whether it has the primary \nobligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion \nand other factors to determine whether it controls the goods or \nservice and, therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.\nThe incremental costs of obtaining a contract (i.e., costs \nthat would not have been incurred if the contract had not \nbeen obtained) are recognized as an asset if the Group \nexpects to recover them.\nCertain eligible, nonrecurring costs (e.g. set-up or transition \nor transformation costs) that do not represent a separate \nperformance obligation are recognized as an asset when \nsuch costs (a) relate directly to the contract; (b) generate \nor enhance resources of the Group that will be used in \nsatisfying the performance obligation in the future; and (c) are \nexpected to be recovered.\nCapitalized contract costs, relating to upfront payments to \ncustomers, are amortized to revenue and other capitalized \ncosts are amortized to expenses over the respective contract \nlife on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods \nor services to customer to which the asset relates.

To assess whether a contract conveys the \nright to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses \nwhether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) \nthe Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use \nof the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Group has \nthe right to direct the use of the asset.\nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Group recognizes \na right-of-use asset (\u201cROU\u201d) and a corresponding lease liability \nfor all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases \nwith a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and \nlow value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the \nGroup recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense \non a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nAs a lessee, the Group determines the lease term as the non-\ncancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend \nor terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably \ncertain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease \nterm on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it \nis reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate \nthe contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the \nCompany considers factors such as any significant leasehold \nimprovements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating \nto the termination of the lease and the importance of the \nunderlying asset to Group\u2019s operations taking into account \nthe location of the underlying asset and the availability of \nsuitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is \nreassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current \neconomic circumstances.Certain lease arrangements include the options to extend or \nterminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets \nand lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably \ncertain that they will be exercised.\nThe right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which \ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for \nany lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date \nof the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. \nThey are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated \ndepreciation and impairment losses.\nRight-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement \ndate on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term \nand useful life of the underlying asset.\nRight-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying \namounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment \ntesting, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair \nvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an \nindividual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash \nflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In \nsuch cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash \nGenerating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the \npresent value of the future lease payments. The lease payments \nare discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if \nnot readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates \nin the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are \nremeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right \nof use asset if the Group changes its assessment to whether it will \nexercise an extension or a termination option.\nLease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in \nthe Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as \nfinancing cash flows.\nThe Group as a lessor\nLeases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially \nall the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified \nas operating leases.\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is \nclassified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.\nFor operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4802, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7072a7a9-2d49-46e1-ad40-c839eaa28cd7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7072a7a9-2d49-46e1-ad40-c839eaa28cd7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "321", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "abe69af5-af9d-449d-8407-94e017235e80", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "321", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "0c7572db5acb426497dd4748d407d5fa33afa1136beeaa8cf876ec048c401a5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "352f611f-5dfe-4dbf-9e69-0468313ba15c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "321", "file_name": "infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 13133646, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "397193ae32a48975b3f8f9d8ab065fc764ab7dac53b42ecff606d8538c878d18", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5421683-15a3-4e9b-8d9e-c6d546828db8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8a271175d0f3b437e1b571cf780bccb7230027f523d5024a5b85139e2acf12ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in \nthe Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as \nfinancing cash flows.\nThe Group as a lessor\nLeases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease.

Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by \ndividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of \nthe Group by the weighted average number of equity shares \nconsidered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also \nthe weighted average number of equity shares that could have \nbeen issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity \nshares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the \nproceeds receivable, had the equity shares been actually issued \nat fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding \nequity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed \nconverted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at \na later date.

policy\nContingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past \nevents and whose existence will be confirmed only by the \noccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future \nevents, not wholly within the control of the entity, or a present \nobligation that arises from past events but is not recognized \nbecause it is not probable that an outflow of resources

report information about operating \nsegments and related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers. The Group's operations \npredominantly relate to providing end-to-end business solutions to enable clients to enhance business performance. The Chief \nOperating Decision Maker (CODM) evaluates the Group's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various \nperformance indicators by business segments. Accordingly, information has been presented along business segments. The accounting \nprinciples used in the preparation of the financial statements are consistently applied to record revenue and expenditure in individual \nsegments, and are as set out in the accounting policies.\nBusiness segments of the Group are primarily enterprises in Financial Services and Insurance, enterprises in Manufacturing, enterprises \nin Retail, Consumer Packaged Goods and Logistics, enterprises in the Energy, Utilities, Resources and Services, enterprises in \nCommunication, Telecom OEM and Media, enterprises in Hi-Tech, enterprises in Life Sciences and Healthcare and all other segments. \nThe\u00a0Financial services reportable segments has been aggregated to include the Financial Services operating segment and Finacle \noperating segment because of the similarity of the economic characteristics. All other segments represent the operating segments of \nbusinesses in India, Japan and China, Infosys Public Services and other enterprises in Public Services.\nRevenue and identifiable operating expenses in relation to segments are categorized based on items that are individually identifiable \nto that segment. Revenue for 'all other segments' represents revenue generated by Infosys Public services and revenue generated from \ncustomers located in India, Japan and China and other enterprises in Public Services. Allocated expenses of segments include expenses \nincurred for rendering services from the Group's offshore software development centers and on-site expenses, which are categorized \nin relation to the associated efforts of the segment. Certain expenses such as depreciation and amortization, which form a significant \ncomponent of total expenses, are not specifically allocable to specific segments as the underlying assets are used interchangeably. \nThe\u00a0Management believes that it is not practical to provide segment disclosures relating to those costs and expenses, and accordingly \nthese expenses are separately disclosed as \"unallocated\" and adjusted against the total income of the Group.\nAssets and liabilities used in the Group's business are not identified to any of the reportable segments, as these are used interchangeably \nbetween segments. The Management believes that it is currently not practicable to provide segment disclosures relating to total assets \nand liabilities since a meaningful segregation of the available data is onerous.\nBusiness segment revenue information is collated based on individual customers invoiced or in relation to which the revenue is \notherwise recognized.\nDisclosure of revenue by geographic locations is given in Note 2.18, Revenue from operations.\nBusiness segments\nYears ended March 31, 2023  and March 31, 2022 :\n(In \u20b9 crore)\nParticulars Financial \nServices (1)Retail
