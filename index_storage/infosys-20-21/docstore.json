Are we \nefficient in the way we operate? Are we continuously \nunlocking innovation potential for the business?  \nThese are the questions that have led several \nenterprises to move to the cloud, over the past decade, \nin search of the answers. In the wake of the global \ncrisis, as our world turned increasingly virtual, the \nneed to accelerate the journey to the cloud, in order \nto digitize, became even more urgent. Slowing down \nmeant risking the organization\u2019s operational resilience \nor worse, being disrupted by a nimbler attacker who is \nbetter prepared for the next normal.\nEven as the cloud grows in strategic relevance for \ncompanies, capturing the full extent of its promised \nvalue remains a struggle for many businesses. The \nchallenge lies in their ability to evolve their cloud \ninvestments from being a technology-funding \nmechanism that prioritizes features requested by \nthe business in the near-term, to becoming critical \nenterprise investment that allows the business to add \ndifferentiating capabilities quickly and continuously in \nthe future. Without this plan and the operating model \nto action it, companies will be unable to build their \ncloud-powered enterprise that efficiently and securely \nmeets escalating business and customer expectations \nof agility and innovation. We know that the future of enterprise cloud strategy \nwill be shaped by three key factors \u2013 business agility, \nscaled innovation and security of the ecosystem. That\u2019s \nwhy we seek to deliver for organizations the cloud\u2019s \nfull value potential by driving these three factors \nthrough their end-to-end cloud transformation. We \nenable businesses to redesign the enterprise from \nthe core, and also build new cloud-first capabilities \nto create seamless experiences in public, private and \nhybrid cloud, across PaaS, SaaS, and IaaS landscapes. \nOur thriving cloud community brings enterprises the \nability to rapidly launch new solutions and create \nbusiness models to meet changing market needs. \nThe community is further amplified by the Infosys \npartner ecosystem that brings together the hyperscale \ncloud providers, enterprise app providers, startups \nand several other technology innovators. We keenly \nappreciate the need to integrate security by design \ninto this landscape and ensure the business complies \nwith the most stringent global, regional and industry \nsecurity standards.\nThe capability to do all this and more comes to us from \nInfosys CobaltTM \u2013 a powerful set of services, solutions, \nand platforms for enterprises to accelerate their cloud \njourney.

To accelerate their pioneering \nautomotive engineering, they were keen to deepen \nfocus on software engineering. With software \nbecoming modular and IT infrastructure becoming \nbig, Daimler planned to take three steps at once to \ntransform their IT infrastructure: consolidation, scaling \nand modernization. They knew they needed to think \ninfrastructure beyond the size of their company. \nTo realize this aspiration, they needed a robust IT \noperating model, fully scalable, on-demand digital IT \ninfrastructure, and anytime-anywhere workplace. Their \npriority was to transform their workplace services, \nservice desk, data center, networks and SAP Basis.\nThe automotive and mobility giant has started to work \nwith Infosys to build a model that ensures robust IT \ninfrastructure for its plants across regions, supports \nconsolidation of its data centers, scales its IT operations, and brings multiple innovations to the fore. Some of \nthe key deliverables from this partnership include:\n \u2022A smart hybrid cloud, leveraging Infosys Cobalt and \nleading cloud providers, accelerating the multi-\ncloud journey with a focus on open source adoption\n \u2022A carbon-neutral solution, by consolidating and \nrationalizing data centers across all regions\n \u2022Standardized technology stack by bringing in an \necosystem of best-of-breed partners\n \u2022Creation of a state-of-the-art Zero Trust network \nwith seamless technology upgrades\n \u2022Persona-driven and cognitive, AI-powered, \nanytime -anywhere workplace solution that \nempowers end-users\nThe Infosys solution for Daimler aims at smoothly \nnavigating the company from its current mode of \noperation to future mode of operation. This journey \nstarted with monetizing Daimler\u2019s legacy assets \nupfront, delivering immediate operational expense \nsavings upfront and underwriting the capital outlay \nneeded to fund advances in infrastructure, technology \nand cloud transformation without needing additional \nspending. The strategy, deploying these tactics, will \nseamlessly move Daimler closer to their future mode \nof operation with bigger operational expense savings, \nwhile helping them nurture an agile and resilient \ninnovation infrastructure at scale.

\nNandan M. Nilekani\nChairmanEven in the midst of the most tumultuous time that the \nworld has seen in over a century, we can look at Infosys\u2019 \nperformance for fiscal 2021 with quiet satisfaction. \nInfosys has delivered industry-leading growth and is \nin pole position for another year of market-leading \nperformance as we start looking at the post-pandemic, \npost-cloud era. \nWhat is it that our company is doing differently that \nis enabling us to be a market leader when several \nveterans around us struggle? \nFirst and foremost, under our CEO, Salil Parekh, ably \nsupported by the global senior leadership, Infosys has \ntransformed into a very client-focused company. Our \nstable and motivated leadership is working quietly \nand without fuss to ensure Infosys is the partner of \nchoice for the world\u2019s top companies as they navigate \ntheir next in these uncertain and rapidly changing \ntimes. This has led to unprecedented transformational \nlarge\u00a0deals. \nSecond, the company is investing in designing and \ndeveloping the right solutions required for accelerating \ndigital transformation. Be it Infosys CobaltTM for \ncloud solutions, modernization without disruption, \nbig data and analytics, applied AI and automation, \ncybersecurity, consumerization of user experience, or \na robust innovation ecosystem \u2013 these have struck the \nright chord with our clients who are keen to assimilate \nnew ideas to reinvent themselves and become more \nlike digital natives. \nThird, the reinvention and modernization of Infosys\u2019 \nown digital infrastructure has prepared the company \nwell to enable our employees to work from home \nseamlessly and be highly productive with digital \ntools made available at their fingertips. It has also \nbrought greater credibility to the transformation we \npropose to our clients \u2013 as these principles of the Live \nEnterprise have emerged and evolved from our own \nhard\u00a0experience.Finally, investments in our people have ensured that \nour employees have access to the latest digital skills \nand are embracing agile ways of working. We have \nlaunched the Infosys Expanded Stock Ownership \nProgram 2019, become more global, diverse, and \ndeeply engaged with our widely dispersed teams in \nmore than 50 countries working from their homes. We \nhave created a strong leadership pipeline to work with \ntrained and motivated employees who have more than \nproven their mettle working through the pandemic. \nBeyond business, Infosys has been at the forefront \nof the ESG movement and became carbon-neutral \nin 2020 \u2013 30 years ahead of the timeline set by the \nParis\u00a0Agreement. \nThe proactive action that Infosys has taken, over the \nlast three and a half years, has decisively enabled \nus to set the narrative for the global digital services \nand consulting industry. Infosys will continue to \ninnovate and is well-placed to lead the industry in the \ncoming\u00a0years. \nToday the world is simultaneously seeing three \nmajor transitions \u2013 the pandemic-induced model for \nhybrid work which requires new ways to collaborate, \norchestrate and deliver, the technology transformation \ndriven by cloud, and the digital acceleration of business \nmodels that are changing the way we live, work, \nplay, and relate to one another over digital channels. \nNever before have our clients so overwhelmingly \nexpressed the need for a voice of clarity in the chaos \nand confusion. They are vocal in their ask for a partner \nwho puts clients\u2019 best interests over their own and for a \nthought leader who can navigate them to their future. \nOur company is committed to being that partner \nfor our clients and will work on this promise with \nrelentless\u00a0execution.\n14 | The future of enterprise: Driven by hybrid work, digital acceleration and cloud Infosys Annual Report 2020-21The future of enterprise: Driven by hybrid work, \ndigital acceleration and cloud\n\u201cThe company is \ninvesting in designing \nand developing the \nright solutions required \nfor accelerating digital \ntransformation. \u201d\nInfosys Annual Report 2020-21", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4089, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "19ddea48-bfd4-48ac-be16-0a6665086f41": {"__data__": {"id_": "19ddea48-bfd4-48ac-be16-0a6665086f41", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "151361e3-c920-49b3-bcfa-908443b0e318", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "b367beeda4d3a5ebcb415e7884b9de0f6868618b1f76bd3e02f48227eefa1437", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "36d11f3f-76ab-4608-8b68-177f28a2cd60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "5d37de15fddd5de168b85e9e7a868e4bc8cab016bf243829a710a0e04aca2709", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "096466e2-57dd-4002-b942-d25cf6ac59d9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "77ba79caed8a565c2ca33315286ba61b29f8f678f7e97f6be80b3249ce700445", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Letter to the Shareholder | 17 \nSalil Parekh\nChief Executive Officer  \nand Managing DirectorLetter to the Shareholder\nDear Shareholder,\nMy sincere wishes that each of you is safe and well in \nthese times.\nOver this past year, we were extremely focused to \nensure the safety and wellbeing of our over 250,000 \nemployees.

Public Services and other enterprises in public services\nGlobal health pandemic from COVID-19 \nIn fiscal 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first broke, \nInfosys swiftly reacted by providing the required support to the workforce, clients and the community . From setting up a core team to monitor the situation closely and staying in constant touch with the local authorities, sharing timely updates with the global employee base, to enabling the near-seamless transition to the remote mode of work \u2013 the Company scaled up its efforts quickly and restored normalcy of operations. Central to these efforts was the need to ensure the physical safety and mental wellbeing of our global workforce. In the early months of the pandemic, through its employee repatriation effort, Infosys managed the evacuation of 1,865 employees and 1,165 members of their families, from 35 countries \u2013 a one-of-its-kind operation by a company .\nFiscal 2021 has seen the health crisis deepen, and the world\u2019s \nattention is focused on India\u2019s response to it. With so many global businesses relying on India\u2019s technology services sector to run their core operations, the industry\u2019s resilience has wide-ranging global impact. Corporations, along with delivering business continuity for clients, must, with renewed vigor, ensure the wellbeing of their employees and the communities in which they operate.\nToday , 96.5% of Infosys employees continue to work \nfrom home. With a more virulent surge of the pandemic in India, Infosys has ramped up its efforts significantly to mitigate the impact of the virus. We have set up exclusive COVID-19 care centers across seven Development Center (DC) locations, including Bengaluru, Pune, NCR, Chennai, and Hyderabad, and similar centers are on the anvil in the coming weeks across all other Infosys locations. We plan to, subject to approvals, set up similar centers in other Indian cities where we have campuses. We tied up with COVID-19 testing laboratories across India, collaborated with emergency ambulance providers in major cities, and partnered with 1,500+ hospitals, in 240 cities in India, to enable treatment for employees and their families. All medical treatments for COVID-19 are covered under employee insurance, and employees who have contracted it are allowed 21 days of additional paid leave to recuperate. Employee wellbeing checks are conducted frequently . In the event of an unfortunate turn, Infosys offers support to the grieving family , including financial support through insurance.\nComprehending the importance of the role played by vaccines \nin our fight against the virus, we have been working very closely with government authorities and medical experts to put together various frameworks for the immunization drive to encourage employees and their family members to get vaccinated. We have created COVID-19 vaccination centers across Infosys campuses. Operations have commenced across seven DCs already and work is in progress in other DCs. We have also collaborated with 130+ hospitals in India where employees and their families can be vaccinated. Committed as always to holistic employee wellbeing, we have rolled out over 900+ employee initiatives across locations, centered on mental health, self-care, and prioritizing work-life balance.\nInfosys\u2019 helping hand extends beyond business. We have \nhonored the commitment of \n` 100 crore for COVID-19 \nrelief in India that we made in March 2020, through the Infosys Foundation. This will help expand the capacity of COVID-care hospital beds, increase the supply of oxygen concentrators and ventilators, as well as provide food and funds to migrant laborers impacted by the lockdowns. We also leveraged our technological expertise, creating mobile applications like \u2018Crush Covid RI\u2019 and \u2018Apthamitra\u2019 to help local governments in their fight against COVID-19.\nOur focus on our client commitments remained unwavering \nthrough this period, reflecting in the record number of large deals we secured even while working remotely . With our operations teams ensuring smooth work-from-home processes and remote collaboration for our 2,60,000+ global workforce, we were able to ensure that client service-level agreements (SLAs) were met and project milestones delivered on time.

We continue to remain carbon-neutral for fiscal 2021. Our detailed, independently assured ESG Report will be available at https://www.infosys.com/sustainability/documents/infosys-esg-report-2020-21.pdf.\nResource conservation initiatives\nJudicious use of resources (mainly energy and water) is necessary to avoid environmental and socio-economic problems. Resource conservation is important at all levels to ensure a healthy environment and equitable distribution in society . At Infosys, what started as a simple energy metering exercise back in 2008 to identify wastage and opportunities for savings, spiraled into one of the largest enterprise-level resource conservation initiative. Super -efficient new buildings, deep retrofits in existing \nbuildings, smart automation, water management initiatives and waste management projects have contributed in reducing our environmental impact significantly . At Infosys, we have been able to grow our business in a sustainable manner, without a proportionate increase in consumption of resources.\nInvestments in renewable energy have helped in reducing \nour emissions, and high-impact carbon offset projects have enabled us to offset our emissions. \nEnergy: Our new buildings continue to push the boundaries \nof innovation and efficiency , setting an example for the industry . We commenced operations of a 7,300-seater super-efficient campus in Bengaluru with several innovative technologies implemented in construction technique, lighting, air-conditioning, parking management, etc. The/uni00A0facility uses \ninnovative radiant cooled technology , the largest of its kind in India. Our/uni00A0enterprise- level energy-efficiency retrofit program \ntransforms existing buildings into efficient ones. Smart automation has enabled remote monitoring, control and optimization of building operations across over 30 million sq.ft. of space. This has helped us manage our operations efficiently and uninterrupted in the current situation caused by the pandemic, ensuring health and safety of employees as well as operations personnel.\nRetrofits: Taking advantage of unoccupied offices due \nto employees working from home, retrofit projects on \nlighting, air conditioning, UPS have been implemented in several critical areas, which, in a normal scenario, would need a shutdown of buildings, inconveniencing employees as well as disrupting operations. Accelerated phase-out of R-22 refrigerant-based air-conditioning units is initiated for improving energy efficiency and simultaneously , use of units with refrigerants which have zero ODP and low GWP , thus enabling reduction of GHG emissions as well.\nEnergy-efficiency retrofits have helped us reduce connected \nload by 34.6 MW across Infosys. Retrofit projects were taken up for the following reasons: resource conservation, end-of-life of equipment, indoor environment quality improvement, and technology upgrade. \nThe capital investment in energy conservation projects was \nabout \n` 5 crore in fiscal 2021.\nRenewable energy: We have a total capacity of 60 MW of solar PV , including rooftop and ground-mounted systems. We/uni00A0continue to pursue green power purchase from third-party power producers and continue working with governments to enable favorable policies for scaling up green power by corporates in India.\nGreen buildings: In fiscal 2021, our new buildings in Indore \nand Hubballi were awarded the LEED Platinum certification \nfrom the US Green Building Council. We also received IGBC \nPlatinum certification (Interiors category) for our leased space in Pune. With this, we now have 37 projects at Infosys with the highest level of green building certification, spanning a total area of 26.07 million sq.ft. An additional 3.45 million sq.ft. of our ongoing projects is currently undergoing \ngreen building certification.\nAll our new buildings follow the highest standard of resource \nefficiency resulting in minimum impact to the environment. In the process, we also aim to achieve the highest level of green building certification.\nWater management: We follow the 3 Rs strategy \u2013 Reduce, \nRecycle and Reuse \u2013 for effective water management. Demand- side measures and awareness creation, smart \nmetering to track real-time water usage and advanced technology sewage treatment plants, have reduced our water consumption significantly . Additionally , rainwater harvesting through lakes, recharge wells and rooftop rainwater collection further reduce dependency on external sources and have a positive impact on the water table.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5009, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e02f0001-78b8-48c8-aeda-a2db2f835299": {"__data__": {"id_": "e02f0001-78b8-48c8-aeda-a2db2f835299", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0b888408-8895-46b9-ba66-8ea447b6cdd9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "16eda6f7c97bda413f49e73298e325325fbd017f4ccab248c20e62722d0f6cf1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d82fdaff-602f-4a99-b55f-0adddce06958", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "5da675c541b54836d8039ab63b03ae57f3713e0d64cc2862c5ebba521be6a104", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4eb311d4-b761-4d4c-ba6a-d6ac83afb8b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "207a0118a7efd32766a115bf0e2349aa45704fc4b9837872e086be4c6014f9b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "With this, we now have 37 projects at Infosys with the highest level of green building certification, spanning a total area of 26.07 million sq.ft.

Given the nature of our operations, despite our best efforts in reducing / avoiding emissions within our boundaries, a sizeable emissions basket remains. These/uni00A0 include emissions from business travel, employee commute, etc. While Infosys continues to have a choice to offset through carbon credits that are offered in the market, we made a deliberate choice \u2013 a choice to get involved in every action aimed to reduce and / or avoid emissions. This/uni00A0year, we added one new household biogas project, in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, to our program portfolio bringing the total number of carbon offset projects to nine. These include efficient cook stoves (five projects), biogas (three projects) and rural electrification (one project). \nUpon completion, these projects will benefit over 1,75,000 families. As of fiscal 2021, we have taken our project coverage to over 1,19,000 families, while also creating over 2,600 jobs. \nOur projects align with India\u2019s \ncommitment to the United Nations \nSustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs), including poverty reduction, good health and wellbeing, clean energy , and climate action, among others.\nHealth, safety and environment\nOne of the hallmarks of our efforts to provide a safe and healthy workplace has been the establishment of a robust Health, Safety and Environmental Management System (HSEMS) christened Ozone. The driving force behind this has been the various requirements from multiple stakeholders, including clients, internal customers, vendor partners, law enforcement/uni00A0/ regulatory bodies, and the communities in which we operate. Systems have been established in accordance with internationally-recognized standards / specifications, and Infosys is certified a ISO14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 in our India locations. Protecting the environment, providing the right workplace ambience, and safeguarding health and safety of personnel, including employees, contract workers and visitors, are strategic priorities for us. The HSEMS includes well-defined policies and procedures and also strives to keep interested parties well-informed, trained and committed to our HSE process.\nTechnology absorption\nLive Enterprise@Infosys: An enterprise that senses, feels and responds in real time \u2013 this was the theme of our transformation journey of the last two years. It had to be a mobile-first approach so that employees are connected to the organization wherever they are in the world and can access the organization assets to learn and contribute. The/uni00A0response has been phenomenal, with all our key processes becoming faster and more responsive, with more than 80% of our employees experiencing 250+ features on the InfyMe app, which is built on the latest open source stack. To enable all of this, our core back-end infrastructure was transformed to host modern applications, using the scalability of cloud, security of on-premise infrastructure in a hybrid cloud deployment using open source technologies with highly scalable container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes for microservices. Telemetry infrastructure using the ELK stack provides enhanced real-time visibility and enabled proactive error detection and correction.\nEnterprise storage modernization: As part of new technology \nadoption, we have successfully modernized our enterprise storage platform. The entire migration was completed with zero downtime. This platform adopted latest storage disk technology , which drives enhanced performance up to 10X, compression and deduplication advantages along with data availability guarantee. This initiative delivered power savings of 46% for this landscape.\nInfrastructure-as-code: Infrastructure as code is a \ntransformational initiative towards enabling continuous deployment, continuous integration, and touchless management of the life cycle of infrastructure components. This methodology overcomes the traditional challenges like growing scale of infrastructure, elastic demand, speed and consistency of deployment and the interdependency between teams. This initiative delivered 1,200+ playbooks for automating platform-related processes across hybrid cloud.\nCloud-native application platform: As part of modernizing \napplications, some of the applications need to be exposed to different user bases with varied authentication mechanisms.

Companies are rapidly adopting digital technologies to reimagine their cost structures, increase business resilience and agility , personalize experiences for their customers and employees, and launch new and disruptive products and services. While these trends have been unfolding for a few years now, they have been accelerated because of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting shifts.\nLeveraging technologies and models of the digital era to both \nextend the value of existing investments and, in parallel, transform and future-proof businesses, is increasingly becoming a top strategic imperative for business leaders. From an IT perspective, the renewal translates to re-imagining human-machine interfaces, extracting value out of digitized data, building next-generation software applications and platforms, harnessing the efficiency of distributed cloud computing, modernizing legacy technology landscapes and strengthening information security and data privacy controls.\nThe fast pace of technology change and the need for technology \nprofessionals who are highly skilled in both traditional and digital technology areas are driving businesses to rely on third parties to realize their business transformation. Several new technology solution and service providers have emerged over the years, offering different models for clients to consume their solution and service offerings, such as data analytics companies, software-as-a-service businesses, cloud platform providers, digital design boutiques, and specialty business process management firms.\nWhile these developments present strong market \nopportunities for the IT industry , there is also an imperative need for IT services and solutions companies to transition from fast-commoditizing traditional service offerings, to attract and retain quality talent globally , to reimagine cost structures and leverage automation for increased productivity .\nII. Opportunities and threats\nOur strategy\nOur clients and prospective clients are faced with transformative business opportunities due to advances in software and computing technology .

Revenue on time-and-material and unit-of-work-based contracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or using a percentage- of-completion method when the pattern of \nbenefits from the services rendered to the customer and our costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a \u201cright to use\u201d the licenses is recognized at the time the license is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a \u201cright to access\u201d is recognized over the access period. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service, the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as the implementation is performed. The percentage of revenue from fixed- price \ncontracts for the years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 is approximately 50%.\nOur revenues are segmented into onsite and offshore revenues. \nOnsite revenues are for those services which are performed at client locations or at our development centers outside India, while offshore revenues are for services which are performed at our global development centers in India.The percentage of our revenues by location from billable IT services professionals for fiscals 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nin %\nParticulars Consolidated\n2021 2020\nOnsite revenue 52.1 54.8\nOffshore revenue 47.9 45.2\nTotal 100.0 100.0\nThe proportion of work performed at our facilities and at client sites varies from period to period. The services performed onsite typically generate higher revenues per capita, but at lower gross margins in percentage as compared to the services performed at our own facilities in India. Therefore, any increase in the onsite effort impacts our margins.\nThe reduction in onsite revenue mix is mainly on account of \nreduced onsite effort mix which is significantly on account of travel restrictions in the year to onsite locations due to pandemic and client focus on cost take-outs.\nThe details of billable hours expended for onsite and \noffshore on our IT services professionals for fiscals 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nin %\nParticulars Consolidated\n2021 2020\nOnsite effort 25.8 28.1\nOffshore effort 74.2 71.9\nTotal 100.0 100.0\nRevenues and gross profits are also affected by employee utilization rates.

Outlook, risks and concerns\nThis section lists forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these statements as a result of certain factors. Our outlook, risks and concerns are as follows:\nGlobal health pandemic from COVID-19 related/uni00A0risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is a global humanitarian and health crisis, which continues to impact key geographies that we operate in, with many countries reporting second and third waves of infections. The actions taken by various governments to contain the pandemic, such as closing of borders and lockdown restrictions, have resulted in significant disruption to people and businesses. While vaccines have been made available, there are delays in vaccinating larger populations, increased instances of variants and infections, and consequential stress on the health sector. Consequently , market demand in some segments and supply chains have been affected. India, where most of our operations are located, is experiencing a second wave of infections, including with new variants of the COVID-19 virus. There/uni00A0 is a marked increase in the number of cases across regions where our development centers are located, and a small percentage of our employees or their families have been adversely affected. We/uni00A0have initiated several interventions to help our employees and their families, including establishing COVID Care Centers and vaccination centers, and providing them access to medical care facilities. However, the continued stress on the medical infrastructure and increasing cases in the country may impact the health and safety of our employees. In addition, India/uni00A0may experience future waves, which may further stress the healthcare ecosystem. This/uni00A0may impact our ability to service our customer requirements on time, as a portion of our employees may be absent from work owing to health issues or to tend to their families.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and may further \nimpact, all of our stakeholders \u2013 employees, clients, vendors, investors and communities we operate in. During fiscal 2021, the impact on revenue due to supply and demand risks we experienced from the COVID-19 pandemic was not significant. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened several other risks that are described in this section. Some of the specific consequent risks related to the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic that have materialized include the following:\n\u2022 Some of our clients\u2019 business operations have been \nnegatively impacted due to the economic downturn, resulting in postponement, termination or suspension of some ongoing projects in the initial period of the financial/uni00A0year.\n\u2022 Our ability to continue to deliver service delivery obligations while our employees work from home is sometimes constrained by contractual terms with our clients and is therefore dependent on receiving the requisite approvals from them on time.\n\u2022 Restrictions on travel have marginally impacted our ability to assign and deploy people at required locations and times to deliver contracted services, thereby impacting our revenue and / or profitability .\n\u2022 Our profitability has been marginally impacted as some clients have sought price reductions or discounts.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4553, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b50b5172-da5e-46fa-b76e-164307768f89": {"__data__": {"id_": "b50b5172-da5e-46fa-b76e-164307768f89", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8240f29c-5786-46b1-9df9-006a56f6a71a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "09d234a76fd9a649e8818bb1897b11078d9e546090f2842e63b1f7d623d6b032", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8848d731-f7a0-464a-992a-d713b7a1cb4b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "6a21bee5e6ff4270a012dd2eebbb83d9123c002eda6573b29ba5e23040f53db7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "41465cd2-cb9b-4ff5-9f42-8e5cdbe5a21e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0b2cf0134d3d41b7c4fe3a4628542fd07fe2a46a24b6efcedb9feff03010275f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened several other risks that are described in this section.

Additionally , any sudden change in demand may impact utilization in the short term, thereby impacting margins.\n\u2022 Our profitability may be marginally impacted as some clients may dispute some of the existing work-in-process that has been recognized by us as unbilled revenues. This in turn can impact our profitability and cash flows/uni00A0negatively .\n\u2022 Our exposure to cybersecurity and data privacy breach incidents may increase due to a large number of employees working remotely . This in turn can hinder our ability to continue services and / or operations, impacting revenue, profitability and reputation.\n\u2022 The productivity of our employees may be negatively impacted due to isolated remote working from home, quarantine requirements, negative social sentiment and personal anxiety .\n\u2022 We have recently announced that we will cover vaccination costs of our employees and their families and also agreed to provide financial support to affected employees and their families. This may have an impact on our cost structure which may increase if there is an increase in vaccination costs or support extended.\n\u2022 Due to the rising number of COVID-19 cases in India, with the prolonged second wave and predicted future waves in the regions where most of our employees are located, there may be fulfilment challenges if our employees are on leave as a result of having contracted COVID-19 directly or to take care of anyone in their family .\n\u2022 Our operations may get disrupted after the reopening of our campuses and offices if any of our returning employees test positive for COVID-19.\n\u2022 We could be subject to lawsuits from our employees alleging they are exposed to health risks as we transition them back to working from our or our clients\u2019 offices.\n\u2022 Our ability to procure goods and services may be impacted as some of our suppliers may not able to operate efficiently during a lockdown.\n\u2022 Unfavorable currency movements during these times may impact our profitability .\n\u2022 An increase in insurance premium on the regular policies that we avail may adversely impact our profitable growth or coverage.\u2022 There could be heightened regional or macro risks such as an increase in unemployment, protectionism, immigration reform, extended recession in the economy , geo-political tension and social unrest.\n\u2022 Many educational institutions in India, which are a primary source of our talent, have postponed students assessments due to the ongoing second wave of COVID-19. This/uni00A0may affect the timely supply of fresh graduates that we plan to hire this year.\n\u2022 The uncertainty in demand as our clients deal with a prolonged economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may cause us to implement severe cost control measures including reduction in employee bonuses. This could result in increased attrition of employees and / or a higher expenditure on recruitment and sub-contracting services, thereby impacting our profitability .\n\u2022 If the market price of our shares / ADSs remain low due to a prolonged recession, the value of RSUs and the ability to achieve the performance targets of the PSUs we have given to our employees may reduce.

Risks related to legislation and regulatory \ncompliance\n\u2022 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding substantial increases in unemployment rates across certain countries in which we operate, including the United States, United Kingdom, EU and Australia, governments have led and may in the future lead to the enactment of restrictive legislations that could limit companies in those countries from outsourcing work to us, or could inhibit our ability to staff client projects in a timely manner thereby impacting our revenue and profitability . \n\u2022 New and changing regulatory compliance, corporate governance and public disclosure requirements add uncertainty to our compliance policies and increase our costs of compliance.\n\u2022 The intellectual property laws of India do not give sufficient protection to software and the related intellectual property rights to the same extent as those in the US. We may be unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights. We may also be subject to third-party claims of intellectual property infringement.\n\u2022 Our net income would decrease if the Government of India reduces or withdraws tax benefits and other incentives it provides to us or when our tax holidays expire, reduce or terminate.\n\u2022 In the event that the Government of India or the government of another country changes its tax policies in a manner that is adverse to us, our tax expense may materially increase, reducing our profitability .\n\u2022 We operate in jurisdictions that impose transfer pricing and other tax-related regulations on us, and any failure to comply could materially and adversely affect our profitability .\n\u2022 Changes in the policies of the Government of India or political instability may adversely affect economic conditions in India generally , which could impact our business and prospects.\n\u2022 Attempts to fully address concerns of activist shareholders may divert the time and attention of our Management and Board of Directors and may impact the prices of our equity shares and ADSs. \n\u2022 Our international expansion plans subject us to risks inherent to doing business internationally .\u2022 Our ability to acquire companies organized outside India may depend on the approval of the RBI and / or the Government of India and failure to obtain this approval could negatively impact our business.\n\u2022 Indian laws limit our ability to raise capital outside India and may limit the ability of others to acquire us, which could prevent us from operating our business or entering into a transaction that is in the best interests of our shareholders.\n8.

Material developments in human \nresources / industrial relations, including \nnumber of people employed\nOur culture and reputation as a leader in consulting, technology , outsourcing and next-generation digital services enable us to attract and retain some of the best talent.\nHuman resources management\nAt Infosys, we focus on the workplace of tomorrow that promotes innovation and a collaborative, transparent and participative organization culture, and rewards merit and sustained high performance. The focus of human resources management at Infosys is to ensure that we enable each and every employee to navigate the next, not just for clients, but also for themselves.\nThe three key strategic pillars of our Employee \nValue Proposition are:\u2022 Driving Purposeful impact \u2013 \u2018Inspiring them to build what\u2019s next\u2019 \n\u2022 Ensuring continuous learning and career growth \u2013 \u2018Making sure their career never stands still\u2019 \n\u2022 Creating world-class culture and employee experience \u2013 \u2018Navigating further, together\u2019\nHere are the key initiatives of this year:\n\u2022 Talent Anywhere model: As we prepare to thrive in the \nfuture, it is clear that the new workplace will be hybrid remote with distributed teams becoming more prominent. We expect that the change in workplace will encourage different workforce models. In order to be ready and lead the paradigm change in the workplace, we rolled out the Talent Anywhere model in India that provides flexibility of work location for our employees. We have ensured that we abide by the statutory requirements at all times.\n\u2022 Digital transformation: The digital transformation journey that we had embarked on a few years back ensured employees could perform all their transactions online through our various mobile-first apps and could connect and collaborate in the remote-working \u201cnew normal\u201d. \n- Launchpad: We expanded the coverage of Launchpad, our \nmobile app that provides a guided flow for our new hires throughout the onboarding process, making the entire process paperless and faster. It helped us onboard our new hires remotely and make them ready for production. We have seen improvement in employee satisfaction levels with the onboarding process during the pandemic.\n- InfyMe: We continued to enrich the InfyMe app with more services that enabled teams during the pandemic and helped them to operate, connect and collaborate more easily . \n- iEngage: We expanded the reach of iEngage across the geos and helped managers schedule connect sessions with their teams, track attendance, actionize items and provide updates.\n- Infosys Meridian: With its event management platform and ability to allow breakout sessions, Infosys Meridian is fast becoming the go-to platform for all employee engagement events.- Compass: This is not only a one-stop digital platform for all career-related needs of our employees, but also a key lever for reskilling. The platform empowers our workforce to keep pace with the latest digital skills, build their expertise, and explore relevant career opportunities through an internal marketplace. Compass is now available on InfyMe and hence easily accessible to our entire workforce.\n- People analytics: We are also investing heavily in people analytics to transform employee experience. In/uni00A0order to create a data-driven culture, we have come up with two projects: People Dashboard and Data Village, which democratize data and make employee data easily available to managers and HR, to support better decision-making and problem-solving. While we create a data-driven organization and solve business problems using data, we strictly ensure that individual employee data is always protected, guided by our corporate Data Privacy Office and data governance guidelines.\n- Robotic process automation (RPA) in HR: We have started leveraging the power of RPAs in HR to enhance productivity of the operations team and usher in intelligent automation in HR.\n- Manager Code: This guides managers in keeping teams motivated through constant communication and a patient hearing to the challenges and pain points of the team members. \n\u2022 Employee engagement:  Our renewed Employee \nEngagement Framework is based on the 5C\u2019s \u2013 Connect, Collaborate, Celebrate, Care and Culture. Its main objective is to ensure effective engagement, wellbeing and sustained motivation levels among employees in the new hybrid model of work.

Further, the person should not have a material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the company or its subsidiaries, during the two immediate preceding financial years or during the current financial year, apart from receiving remuneration as an independent director.\nWe abide by these definitions of independent director in \naddition to the definitions of an independent director as laid down in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listed company manual, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and US securities laws by virtue of our listing on the NYSE in the/uni00A0US.\nBased on the disclosures received from all the independent \ndirectors and in the opinion of the Board, the independent directors fulfill the conditions specified in the Companies Act, 2013, the Listing Regulations, NYSE listing manual and are independent of the Management.\nThe Board includes six independent directors, out of \nwhich two are women.\nMeeting of independent directors\nSchedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013 and the Rules thereunder mandate that the independent directors of the Company shall hold at least one meeting in a year, without the attendance of non-independent directors and members of the Management. Even before the Companies Act, 2013 came into effect, our Board\u2019s policy mandated periodic meetings attended exclusively by the independent directors. At such meetings, the independent directors discuss, among other matters, the performance of the Company and risks faced by it, the flow of information to the Board, competition, strategy , leadership strengths and weaknesses, governance, compliance, Board movements, human resource matters and performance of the executive members of the Board, including the Chairman. During the year, the independent directors met without the presence of the Management. \nTraining of Board members\nAll new non-executive directors inducted to the Board are introduced to our Company culture through orientation sessions. Executive directors and senior management provide an overview of operations, and familiarize the new non-executive directors on matters related to our values and commitments. They are also introduced to the organization structure, services, Group structure and subsidiaries, constitution, Board procedures, matters reserved for the Board, major risks and risk management strategy . The details of the familiarization program are also available on the Company\u2019s website, at https://www.infosys.com/investors/reports-filings/Documents/training-board-members2021.pdf.\nThe Board\u2019s policy is to have separate meetings regularly with \nindependent directors to update them on all business-related issues and new initiatives. At such meetings, the executive directors and other members of the senior management share points of view and leadership thoughts on relevant issues.\nWe also facilitate the continual educational requirements of \nour directors. Each director is entitled to a training fee of US$ 5,000 per year. Support is provided for independent \ndirectors if they choose to attend educational programs in the areas of Board / corporate governance. Non-executive and independent directors of the Board are familiarized through engagement such as:\nStrategy retreat: As part of our annual strategy planning \nprocess, we organize a management strategy retreat with the Board to deliberate on various topics related to strategic alternatives, progress of ongoing strategic initiatives, risks to strategy execution and the need for new strategic programs to achieve the Company\u2019s long-term objectives. This serves the dual purpose of providing a platform for the Board members to bring their expertise to the projects, while also providing an opportunity for them to understand detailed aspects of execution and challenges relating to the specific theme.

And the heroes of the war \nagainst the virus were the members of our medical community . But each passing day made us acutely aware of the struggles faced by our hospitals, to meet safety requirements for their staff, make space for patients, and curb the fatality rates. As a trust dedicated to philanthropy , Infosys Foundation could not stay uninvolved. \nThe Foundation was one of the first CSR bodies in the \ncountry to announce a relief package of \n` 100 crore for the \npandemic in March 2020. The relief work, which began with setting up of COVID-exclusive hospitals and wards, supply of medical equipment, PPE kits and sanitizers continued pan-India through 2020-21 and is continuing this year. The Bowring & Lady Curzon Medical College & Research Institute, Bengaluru and Chinmaya Mission Hospital (CMH) were among the first to get the Foundation\u2019s support. \nBowring Hospital: Getting a second facility up and runningBowring Hospital was one of the earliest city hospitals to be \nconverted into a dedicated COVID-19 hospital. It wanted to extend COVID care to the new Charaka Superspeciality Hospital on its premises but the construction was yet to be completed. The Foundation quickly stepped in with funds for infrastructure and equipment. A 28-bed Intensive Care Unit, with ventilators, multi-parameter monitors, emergency cart, ambu bag, intubation set and bedside lockers, was set up. For the general ward and casualty section, 140 beds, and equipment including a mobile X-ray machine, ECG machine and trolleys were provided. A cath lab was set up for the cardiology unit, along with two modular operation theaters with necessary infrastructure. The other items provided included a diesel generator, compressor, linen and blankets, furniture, nurse stations, CCTV surveillance systems, UPS, EPABX, medical gas pipeline, HVAC, air conditioning and all electrical and lighting supplies. A total of 600 COVID-19 patients were treated at the Charaka hospital till March 31, 2021. \nChinmaya Mission Hospital: Where ventilators spell hopeAt CMH, following the government directive, 84 beds were \nmade available exclusively for COVID-19 patients in June 2020. To create fully functional COVID-19 wards, the immediate requirement was equipment, and the Foundation pitched in right away . \nFor the COVID wards, the Foundation provided 12 ventilators, \nwhich have subsequently treated over 300 patients, an echo probe machine, which was used for 3,900 patients, a full digital radiography system for the Casualty ward, 15,200 PPE kits and supplies of hand sanitizers for the staff. A car was provided by the Foundation to fetch consultants for emergencies, especially during the night. The Foundation also donated a fund towards the expenses of treatment of underprivileged patients. An amount was donated every month from August to November 2020 to meet the salary expenses of the medical staff to help the hospital recover from its losses due to the lockdown disruption. \nOver 1,200 COVID positive patients were treated at \nCMH till March 2021. \nHelp in time saves livesBowring and CMH Hospitals acknowledged that the timely \nintervention of Infosys Foundation made all the difference to ensure that high-quality medical care was provided at the time of critical need.

For both Prashant and Inali Foundation, Aarohan was the beginning of a successful partnership and journey towards making a social change. In Prashant\u2019s own words\u2026\nAfter completing school, I enrolled for an engineering degree. Soon, I realized that neither was I learning anything, nor was I finding answers to what I wanted to do in life. Eventually , I dropped out, found a job to sustain myself and enrolled in a distance learning Fab Academy course run by the Center for Bits and Atoms at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Boston. \nTo successfully complete the course, each student had to \nwork on a project. It was then that I met Nicolas Huchet from France. Nicolas had lost his right arm but instead of seeing it as a disability , he built his own bionic arm. That was my first inspiration. \nSoon after, I met a seven-year old girl born without arms. I \nwanted to give her a chance at life. The company I approached said the estimated cost of both arms would be \n` 24,00,000!\nThat\u2019s when I started to use my insights from the course to prototype prosthetics for those with a missing limb below the elbow. With cheap components, the initial prototypes I created were very low-cost (under \n` 5,000). \nA stepping stone\nAround that time, I heard about the Aarohan Social \nInnovation Awards but did not know who was conducting it. While submitting my entry , I realized it was by the Infosys Foundation and the award focused on innovations driven by empathy towards the less privileged \u2018in the lab called life\u2019. I saw a video by Sudha Murty and I felt she was talking directly to me. \nWhen I was named one of the winning social innovators that \nyear, it was the tipping point. Beyond my personal gain, Inali Foundation \u2013 the trust I began, had come home. \nWith this recognition and fund infusion, Inali Foundation \nwas formally registered as a Section 8 company on May 11, 2018. The Aarohan Award also brought us credibility and validated our innovation within the ecosystem of persons with disability .\nThe funding allowed us to deepen our research and \ndevelopment. We now work on different variations of prosthetics from basic mechanical and electrical to advanced sensor-based versions. The Infosys Foundation connection has sparked interest among other corporate and individual donors as well, enabling us to affix these prosthetics free-of-charge at camps we run across the country .\nHumbled and raring to goRecently , Inali Foundation and its work were featured in the \nbook, When I Grow Up, I Want to Be\u2026. Shortly after, I also got an opportunity to appear on the Karamvir episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati hosted by Amitabh Bachchan. \nDuring the early days of the pandemic, there was an \nurgent need for a Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator Systems (RMVS). We quickly got ready with the initial designs and Infosys Foundation deployed a team from advanced engineering to oversee our designs, with daily consultations and detailed inputs. \nOur association with Infosys Foundation has opened many \ndoors for us. Thanks to it, we are now on a mission to replace the word disability with ability .\nPrashant Gade was a Platinum award winner in the first edition of Infosys Foundation\u2019s Aarohan Awards.\nCorporate governance report  | 122 Infosys Annual Report 2020-21", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3629, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3a86dc90-a8d0-4564-9710-7703d998661c": {"__data__": {"id_": "3a86dc90-a8d0-4564-9710-7703d998661c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "412ee6bd-4113-46f4-8755-a82766324bf0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "cd4d5b8fed7f1c73c4c831577f030afcbfd535f15eb1cfbbea2e745f6c08f467", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ca9f640d-8fb4-497c-8b50-bf8f1a77d507", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "111", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "030bde1c26187148d184808e4dcf353fc8356d6f04b06857a52b1894d8d168b7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4ad4dcf7-5dc1-4990-bd84-cd6edc522e9f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "da922e4155bb17d777db03f9014e7bc75c1c92c1343aa74cd4c9cbff04f30993", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Corporate governance report  | 123 Infosys Annual Report 2020-21Beneficiary:\nIndia Foundation for the Arts (IFA)Art and culture\nHelping the arts find ways to endure, adapt and sustain\nThe arts is one of the biggest changemakers in both the \nglobal and the local economy .

It was at this juncture that IFA reached out to the Foundation for supporting 11 grants across its Arts Practice, Arts Education, and Project 560 programs. \nCreative common groundsThe Foundation committed to supporting 11 grantees of \nIFA, including a theatre group, teachers, and artists with projects in government schools, institutions, and urban communities in Bengaluru. Apart from these primary beneficiaries, the Foundation\u2019s grant will also help secondary beneficiaries, such as schoolchildren, teachers, theater practitioners and audiences.During the initial weeks and months, there was hope that the worst would be over soon. But, as the months unfolded, the fragile gig economies that barely managed to support artists earlier, had their backs broken. The worry wasn\u2019t just about financial sustenance but also of creative and artistic continuity and the ability to adapt to the radical changes everywhere. Online spaces, for instance, while providing new opportunities for work, came with their share of challenges \u2013 the primary one being access. \nSo we may still hopeIFA reached out to the Foundation with suggestions for fixing \nsome long-standing problems in the arts and arts ecology , including systemic and structural inequalities and injustices. \nThese fixes included: \u2022 Creating online platforms to pull in online audiences, \n\u2022 Networking and building collaborations, \n\u2022 Rethinking arts-integrated pedagogies for school education \nand arts pedagogies for teaching in art schools, \n\u2022 Organizing skill-building workshops so that artistes can monetize their art through digital technology , and \n\u2022 Discussing key issues facing the arts.\nThe IFA-Infosys Foundation partnership is supporting 11 projects undertaken by artists, scholars and teachers, and encourage them to continue their work.\nIn these times of isolation and uncertainty , the arts have not \nonly sustained people but also inspired them to fight for better times. Artists work to mend broken worlds and Infosys Foundation is committed to support those who help us find hope and inspiration.\nInfosys Foundation is partnering with IFA to support 11 projects by artists, teachers and scholars.\n123 | Corporate governance report Infosys Annual Report 2020-21", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3481, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4ad4dcf7-5dc1-4990-bd84-cd6edc522e9f": {"__data__": {"id_": "4ad4dcf7-5dc1-4990-bd84-cd6edc522e9f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b3ec518-0425-44b9-be11-0b383a46730b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d229ae579425401aefad52bef8482aa26dae4e327a2973c85b690e0ba44e75ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3a86dc90-a8d0-4564-9710-7703d998661c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "cd4d5b8fed7f1c73c4c831577f030afcbfd535f15eb1cfbbea2e745f6c08f467", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "eec8653f-0233-474f-beb9-99c28350c027", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "141879a263961222a25ab6469d83a7cf2ef8e4556382348186c262c076a1acde", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "124 | Corporate governance report Infosys Annual Report 2020-21Corporate governance report  | 124 Infosys Annual Report 2020-21Beneficiary:\nSociety for Education Action and Research in Community Health (SEARCH) Rural development\nDriven by purpose, led by youth\nWhat is of greater value \u2013 purpose or ambition?

In 2006, SEARCH began NIRMAN, a program to encourage young persons to find a broader purpose to their lives, to spur social action and cultivate a vibrant and supportive community . Infosys Foundation, already a partner for SEARCH, decided to support NIRMAN for 2020-22.\nTrained for social action A rigorous selection process is undertaken to choose each \nbatch of around 160 participants between the ages of 18 and 28. They undergo three residential workshops during the course, along with study visits, educative sessions, reading assignments, internships, fellowships, individual mentoring, individual volunteering, and group activities. After completing the training, the participants develop / decide their area of interest for social contribution. A total of 1,419 participants have undergone this training so far and 444 alumni have worked full-time on specific social challenges across India. \nThe pandemic upset the planned schedule for the 10th \nbatch. However, a batch of 160 participants, including a large number of medical students, was selected in due course. The training workshops, which require physical attendance, had to be put on hold till March-April 2021. Meanwhile, the group was given assignments, reading and action plans and one-on-one mentoring. As part of the publicity and outreach programs, online lectures, webinars and sensitization modules were organized with 21 educational institutes, reaching more than 10,000 viewers. \nThe online selection of the 11th batch of NIRMAN has also been \ncompleted; 160 candidates were selected from a pool of 1,050 applications. The pandemic hindered NIRMAN\u2019s volunteering program, Krutee NIRMAN, too but 20 volunteers managed to contribute more than 290 person days for social action. The Foundation also committed to aid capacity-building of the 12-member NIRMAN team. As part of this, more than 45 presentations were made on research papers, reports and social initiatives, besides reading and sharing of relevant literature, interactions with resource persons, skill-building, one-on-one coaching, online workshops and field visits. \nAlso part of the partnership are three Infosys Foundation \nfellowships to encourage full time work on social challenges. One of the candidates has already received it and two more have been identified. \nBringing change back to the roots The effects of NIRMAN are already visible. The participants \nare on their way to becoming changemakers. But, NIRMAN is not merely a program for social change, it\u2019s the beginning of a revolution led by the youth. Infosys Foundation believes this association has the potential to bring lasting change in the country\u2019s social landscape.\nInfosys Foundation\u2019s support extends to two batches of NIRMAN, SEARCH\u2019s social program for youth.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3727, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "eec8653f-0233-474f-beb9-99c28350c027": {"__data__": {"id_": "eec8653f-0233-474f-beb9-99c28350c027", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f5b611ef-6f25-43a0-8503-73b1ba0c439c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "ded63423e4307b2ef9b72ddafe0cf18b518f960625752e6f4312b691e1772eae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4ad4dcf7-5dc1-4990-bd84-cd6edc522e9f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d229ae579425401aefad52bef8482aa26dae4e327a2973c85b690e0ba44e75ce", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fbc28083-efc5-4c22-ba01-4bd369d0976d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "24f91741117cc61026439ba7fd797807755489da7f3c648edb1b9ef31b787bb2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Corporate governance report  | 125 Infosys Annual Report 2020-21Beneficiary:\nRajya Sainik BoardDestitute care\nFor our heroes, when they need us\nA crisis brings heroes to the fore. During the pandemic, we \nsaw many heroes, who battled on the frontlines to ensure the safety of others. But what of those other heroes, who risk their lives every day for the sake of others \u2013 our army men who stand guard at the borders and ensure our security? Infosys Foundation has been proactively supporting projects that help soldiers and their families, when they retire or are martyred. In one such endeavor, the Foundation has helped to build a Sainik Sadan for the Rajya Sainik Board, Odisha in Bhubaneswar. \nThe Rajya Sainik Board, Odisha, which is under the \nadministrative control of the Home Department, Government of Odisha, acts as a nodal agency for coordinating and implementing various welfare measures of the central and state governments. The Board is committed to promoting welfare measures for war widows, widows of ex-servicemen, World War II veterans and their widows and dependents from Odisha, and the families of the serving soldiers of Odisha. At present, around 42,500 ex-servicemen and widows are registered, and the total dependency is more than 2,00,000. \nA place of comfort for soldiersInfosys Foundation and the Rajya Sainik Board entered into \nan agreement a few years ago to construct a Sainik Sadan for ex-servicemen in Bhubaneswar. The building is expected to be completed in May 2021. The Infosys Foundation Sainik Sadan, as it is called, is spread over 12,400 sq.ft. with ground and three floors and a terrace. The construction work of the building included civil works, finishing, interiors, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) work, plumbing and electrical work, glazing and a passenger elevator. \nThe ground floor of the building will have a 40-seater dining \narea, kitchen and storeroom. The first floor will have two single-occupancy rooms and four dormitories with a total of 17 beds. The second floor will have four dormitories with a total of 21 beds and the third floor will have one double-occupancy room and three dormitories with 18 beds in all. \nTelling them we careMost ex-servicemen visit Bhubaneswar or Cuttack for \nmedical purposes, educational needs of their wards or for administrative and legal requirements. Around 200-300 ex-servicemen and their dependents visit these cities daily and at least 80-100 of them require accommodation for a night or two. A total of 56 people, including ex-servicemen, war widows, widows of ex-servicemen, disabled ex-servicemen and their dependents, can lodge in the Sainik Sadan daily . \nBeyond building a shelter for ex-servicemen who require it, \nthe Infosys Foundation Sainik Sadan is a way of thanking our brave soldiers who have dedicated their lives to the service of the nation. Infosys Foundation is proud to play a part in showing this gratitude.\nThe Infosys Foundation Sainik Sadan helps ex-servicemen and their families in Bhubaneswar.\nFor more details on the Foundation\u2019s activities, visit https://www.infosys.com/infosys-foundation.\n125 | Corporate governance report Infosys Annual Report 2020-21", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3196, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbc28083-efc5-4c22-ba01-4bd369d0976d": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbc28083-efc5-4c22-ba01-4bd369d0976d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7f51de1c-bb2a-434b-888e-0bb5102f2ede", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "115", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3292d09c91e96d49fc334d2414da7c7cc0d0dfda0219a59f74e64bd8bbe59f16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "eec8653f-0233-474f-beb9-99c28350c027", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "ded63423e4307b2ef9b72ddafe0cf18b518f960625752e6f4312b691e1772eae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "bc0e603f-a0f1-46f0-a65b-b72fe2dccd0f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "bc920a3e6e8d6fb91fec6ed4cce1c4181c65cecede76aeefe243617bfff81b29", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "126 | Corporate governance report Infosys Annual Report 2020-21Infosys Foundation USA \nDigital Making at Home workshop conducted by Infosys Foundation \nUSA in association with Raspberry Pi \nThe Infosys Foundation USA was founded in 2015 with the \nmission of expanding computer science and maker education to K-12 students and teachers across the US \u2013 specifically to increase access to communities that are traditionally underrepresented in these fields.

Readers are advised to refer to the detailed discussion of risk factors and related disclosures in our regulatory filings and exercise their own judgment in assessing risks associated with the Company.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function enables \nthe achievement of the Company\u2019s strategic objectives by identifying, analyzing, assessing, mitigating, monitoring and governing any risk or potential threat to these objectives. While this is the key driver, our values, culture and commitment to stakeholders \u2013 employees, customers, investors, regulatory bodies, partners and the community around us \u2013 are the foundation for our ERM framework. \nThe systematic and proactive identification of risks, and \nmitigation thereof, enables our organization to boost performance with effective and timely decision-making.

The ERM function also enables effective resource allocation through structured qualitative and quantitative risk impact assessment and prioritization based on our risk appetite. \nOur ERM framework encompasses all of the Company\u2019s \nrisks, such as strategic, operational, and legal & compliance risks. Any of these categories can have internal or external dimensions. Hence, appropriate risk indicators are used to identify these risks proactively . We take cognizance of risks faced by our key stakeholders and their cumulative impact while framing our risk responses.\nStrategy and strategy execution Risks arising out of the choices we have made in defining our strategy and the risks to the successful execution of our strategy are covered in this category . For example, risks inherent to our industry and our competitiveness are analyzed and mitigated through strategic choices of target markets, our market offerings, business model and talent base.\nOperational Risks affecting our policies, procedures, people and systems, thereby impacting service delivery or operations, or compromising our core values or business practices are covered in this category . For example, risks such as inefficiencies in internal processes, business activity disruptions due to natural calamities, human conflicts, system failures and cybersecurity attacks.\nLegal and compliance Risks arising out of threats posed to our financial, organizational, or reputational standing resulting from litigations, non-conformance with laws, regulatory or geo-political developments, codes of conduct and contractual compliances are covered in this category . \nIntegrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework\nWe have adopted an integrated ERM framework that is implemented across the organization by the risk management office. Our ERM framework is developed by incorporating the best practices based on COSO and ISO 31000 and then tailored to suit our unique business requirements.\n130 | Corporate governance report Infosys Annual Report 2020-21", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3623, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c4fbeb4b-6934-4df4-ab13-5a9d78bf7e8a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c4fbeb4b-6934-4df4-ab13-5a9d78bf7e8a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b86f0616-d52a-4b56-9afc-b82a61a96c9d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "eec035368fb871719122b136d38e69a8d234fcc751640646666d18991eebd086", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e7a6f84-92b1-4b49-880e-a3815fe04ecf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "2f84a3b530305cf316fef04facc9815e6753f81ba97cf0a217a4cb762c723368", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8827be4f-7e92-4bee-aecb-169921f8a74e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce0aae9e56518420146c19bc954bdc9d202c2b49c48a2c849321f3373610de6c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Integrated Enterprise Risk Management Framework\nStrategy and\nbusiness objectives\nIntegrated lines of defense\niGRC platform\nIntelligent risk analytics \u2013 Live EnterpriseValues and\ncultureVision and \nmission \nStrategic and\nstakeholder \ngoals\nDerived\n goals STRA TEGY\nRisk-enabled decision-making\nTreatment, mitigation and\ncontrol implementation\nSecondary and consequential\nrisk assessment\nResidual risk assessment\nand decision-making\nAuditing, monitoring\nand reporting\nRisk governance\nand disclosuresRisk management Risk identi/f_ication\nRisk\nassessment\nOpportunityOperationalLegal and complianc e\nLevel 1 Risk\nLevel 2 Risk\nLevel 3 Risk\nLevel 4 Risk\nSales\nDelivery\nBusiness enabling function\nLevel 5 RiskStrategy ex ecution\nGranularityType of risks\nImpact groupsPERFORMANCE EV ALUATION AND RISK MANA GEMENT\nBoar d of Di rectors\nRisk Management\nCommittee (RM C)\nof the Board\nCybersecurity\nSub -Committe e\nInternal Board\nof Di rectors\nRisk councils\nO\ufb03ce of\nrisk management\nSub-risk councils\nUnit risk councils\nProject and\naccount risk teams9-layer go vernanceGOVERNANC E\nSalient features of our Enterprise Risk Management program\nOur ERM program adopts unique methods to identify risks, evaluate potential impact and promote risk awareness \nacross the organization.\nSecondar y, consequential \nand residual risks\nSecondary risks are threats that could impede \nthe mitigation of primary risks.

The Company \nderives revenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Company\u2019s core and digital offerings and business process management services. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.\nIn certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party \nvendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Company is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Company is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Company first evaluates whether it controls the products or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Company considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed \nthrough an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.\nAs certain contracts with customers involve management\u2019s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance \nobligations, (2) determining whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.\nRefer Notes 1.4 and 2.17 to the Standalone financial statements.\nAuditor\u2019s ResponsePrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of \nwhether the Company is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b)/uni00A0determination of whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method. \n\u2022 We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures: \n\u2013 Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement.\n\u2013 Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management\u2019s conclusions regarding the \n(i) identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Company is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4103, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7d2101ff-ed86-4ada-a540-92f8ca279140": {"__data__": {"id_": "7d2101ff-ed86-4ada-a540-92f8ca279140", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "140", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e2ba663a-7771-4496-9053-fb5dee3a2904", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "140", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "5b159806b228e6e592f539b2675ca5543342727b81bb7639f9d81dc81d1e7715", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b17a98c3-9cae-420c-a929-a5c50d2e690a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "139", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "a4153f2d4c8622c1961a2604ead142b8a1ef59bc674d2a254b68433119e69933", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b9e0f52b-efe4-4a67-81f6-886bb4814239", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "96a32ea5c48777f312ffc395c24b378b6bb033e2bfb9e4864da1b1f657de92e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Standalone financial statements | 151 Infosys Annual Report 2020-21Sr. No. Key Audit Matter\n2 Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed \nthrough an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Company\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Company to determine the actual efforts or costs expended \nto date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity . The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nWe identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage \nof completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contracts. \nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort \nto evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.\nRefer Notes 1.4 and 2.17 to the Standalone financial statements\nAuditor\u2019s ResponsePrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts \nincluded the following, among others:\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured the using percentage-of-completion method and performed the following:\n\u2013 Evaluated management\u2019s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n\u2013 Compared efforts or costs incurred with Company\u2019s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant \nvariations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs or efforts to complete the contract. \n\u2013 Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign \noff from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts to complete the remaining performance obligations.\nInformation Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor\u2019s Report Thereon\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for the other information.

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \nIn preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company\u2019s ability to continue \nas a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. \nThe Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company\u2019s financial reporting process.\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from \nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism \nthroughout the audit.

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery , intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.\n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management.\n\u2022 Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor\u2019s report.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company\u2019s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the \u201cGuidance Note\u201d) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system \nover financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on \nthe Company\u2019s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOpinion\nIn our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2021, based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI. \nFor DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS LLP\nChartered Accountants\n(Firm\u2019s Registration No. 117366W/W-100018)\nPlace: MumbaiDate: April 14, 2021Sanjiv V .

Overview\n1.1 Company overview \nInfosys Limited (\u201cthe Company\u201d or Infosys) provides \nconsulting, technology , outsourcing and next-generation digital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their digital transformation. Infosys\u2019 strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of clients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys\u2019 strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to a digital future. \nThe Company is a public limited company incorporated and \ndomiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics City , Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The/uni00A0Company has its primary listings on the BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company\u2019s American Depositary Shares (ADS) representing equity shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). \nThe standalone financial statements are approved for issue by \nthe Company\u2019s Board of Directors on April 14, 2021.\n1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements \nThese standalone financial statements are prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standard (Ind AS), under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter. \nAccounting policies have been consistently applied except \nwhere a newly-issued accounting standard is initially adopted or a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use.\nAs the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded \nto the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures reported in this statement.\n1.3 Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. The application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.4. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the standalone financial statements.\nEstimation of uncertainties relating to the global health pandemic from COVID-19 (\"COVID-19\") \nThe Company has considered the possible effects that may result from the pandemic relating to COVID-19 in the preparation of these standalone financial statements including the recoverability of carrying amounts of financial and non- financial assets. In developing the assumptions relating \nto the possible future uncertainties in the global economic conditions because of this pandemic, the Company has, at the date of approval of these financial statements, used internal and external sources of information including credit reports and related information and economic forecasts and expects that the carrying amount of these assets will be recovered. The/uni00A0 impact of COVID-19 on the Company\u2019s financial statements may differ from that estimated as at the date of approval of these standalone financial statements.\n1.4 Critical accounting estimates and judgments\na.

Revenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition and measurement when the contract has been approved, in writing, by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable. The Company assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract.

The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.\nProvisions for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted \ncontracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nb. Income taxes \nThe Company\u2019s two major tax jurisdictions are India and the US, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions.\nSignificant judgments are involved in determining the \nprovision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions. Also, refer to Notes 2.16 and 2.22.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, \nthe Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The/uni00A0Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced.\nc. Property, plant and equipment \nProperty , plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Company . The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset\u2019s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of the Company\u2019s assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically , including at each financial year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology (refer to Note. 2.1).\nd. Leases\nInd AS 116 requires lessees to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to Infosys\u2019 operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances. After considering current and future economic conditions, the Company has concluded that no material changes are required to lease period relating to the existing lease contracts (refer to Note 2.3).\ne. Allowance for credit losses on receivables and \nunbilled revenue\nThe Company determines the allowance for credit losses based on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Company considered current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Company deals with and the countries where it operates. In calculating expected credit loss, the Company has also considered credit reports and other related credit information for its customers to estimate the probability of default in future and has taken into account estimates of possible effect from the pandemic relating to COVID-19.\n2.1 Property, plant and equipment\nAccounting policy\nProperty , plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any .

For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value- in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis \nunless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets.

An impairment loss is reversed in the Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

Intangible assets are amortized over their \nrespective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry , and known technological advances), and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.

The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. \nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Company \nrecognizes a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short- term leases) and low-value leases. For these short- term \nand low-value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. \nCertain lease arrangements include the options to extend or \nterminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. \nROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises \nthe initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\nROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date \non a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related ROU asset if the Company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. \nLease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented \nin the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.\nThe Company as a lessor Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a \nfinance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All/uni00A0other leases are classified as operating leases. \nWhen the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts \nfor its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately . The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease. \nFor operating leases, rental income is recognized on a \nstraight- line basis over the term of the relevant lease.\nTransition \nEffective April 1, 2019, the Group adopted Ind AS 116, Leases  \nusing the modified retrospective method.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4475, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8007761f-ebf0-4ddb-ba91-18f84a3e4577": {"__data__": {"id_": "8007761f-ebf0-4ddb-ba91-18f84a3e4577", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b61301b0-e1f3-420b-83b8-13633202e07c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "edf16fa0eb1a8535ae2f2b2c6b30a53fed8f4d13f73e4aecb03eae4c4309846e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7db406e-6700-43dc-9fb1-76d456e3f111", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "160", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "9737e182c3f62f93bea9d83c536e77e79ff47b78c5334f003afacfd83b95a386", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "85e32a6f-5c36-45c4-a805-7f64a90b9ced", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "95a37c5a340eba912ad60e868f8127f7b2333867d36a1585f3529dd08f611fcc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company as a lessor Leases for which the Company is a lessor is classified as a \nfinance or operating lease.

Non-derivative financial instruments \n(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if \nit is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(ii)\n Financial assets at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income (FVOCI)\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Company has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model. \n(iii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossA financial asset which is not classified in any of the above \ncategories is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss. \n(iv) Financial liabilitiesFinancial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized cost \nusing the effective interest method, except for contingent consideration recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\n(v) Investment in subsidiariesInvestment in subsidiaries is carried at cost in the separate \nfinancial statements.\nb. Derivative financial instruments\nThe Company holds derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and options contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank.\n(i) Financial assets or financial liabilities, at fair value \nthrough profit or loss.\nThis category includes derivative financial assets or liabilities which are not designated as hedges.\nAlthough the Company believes that these derivatives \nconstitute hedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. Any derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial liability , at fair value through profit or loss.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially \nat fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets / liabilities in this category are presented as current assets / current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.\n(ii) Cash flow hedgeThe Company designates certain foreign exchange forward \nand options contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions. \nWhen a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge \ninstrument, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedge reserve. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized immediately in the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss. If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively . If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognized in cash flow hedge reserve till the period the hedge was effective remains in cash flow hedge reserve until the forecasted transaction occurs. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in the cash flow hedge reserve is transferred to the net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss upon the occurrence of the related forecasted transaction. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the amount accumulated in cash flow hedge reserve is reclassified to net profit in the Statement of Profit and Loss.\n2.10.3 Derecognition of financial instruments\nThe Company derecognizes a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and the transfer qualifies for derecognition under Ind AS 109.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A/uni00A0deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. The/uni00A0Company offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously .

Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of those deductible differences.

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services (\u201cperformance obligations\u201d) to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company has received or expects to receive in exchange for these products or services (\u201ctransaction price\u201d). When/uni00A0there is uncertainty as to collectability , revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\nThe Company assesses the services promised in a contract \nand identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Company allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Company estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.\nThe Company\u2019s contracts may include variable consideration \nincluding rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The/uni00A0 Company includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nRevenue on time-and-material and unit-of-work-based \ncontracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using a percentage-of-completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Company\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended have been used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity . Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nThe billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic \nperformance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).\nIn arrangements for software development and related \nservices and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Company measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the standalone selling price, the Company uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.\nRevenue from licenses where the customer obtains a \u201cright \nto use\u201d the licenses is recognized at the time the license is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a \u201cright to access\u201d is recognized over the access period.\nArrangements to deliver software products generally \nhave three elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS).When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices.

Diluted earnings per equity share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to the equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of equity shares considered for deriving basic earnings per equity share and also the weighted average number of equity shares that could have been issued upon conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the equity shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding equity shares). Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date. Dilutive potential equity shares are determined independently for each period presented. \nThe number of equity shares and potentially dilutive equity \nshares are adjusted retrospectively for all periods presented for any share splits and bonus shares issues including for changes effected prior to the approval of the financial statements by the Board of Directors.\nA reconciliation of the equity shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per equity share is as follows:\nParticulars Year ended March 31,\n2021 2020\nBasic earnings per equity share \u2013 weighted average number of equity shares outstanding 425,94,38,950 427,70,30,249\nEffect of dilutive common equivalent shares \u2013 share options outstanding 36,53,564 27,78,577\nDiluted earnings per equity share \u2013 weighted average number of equity shares and common equivalent shares outstanding 426,30,92,514 427,98,08,826\nFor the years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, no number of options to purchase equity shares had an anti-dilutive effect.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4163, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f190b5e3-3aa7-4e51-8f9e-48588cbb8441": {"__data__": {"id_": "f190b5e3-3aa7-4e51-8f9e-48588cbb8441", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5474f88d-2c24-47ce-b6ce-e81b15f1a398", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "193", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3293bc5c4e2791899d310e06b556fade9a6567ad8c21dff0458bc847624b9b07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3eee5851-a43d-464a-a404-f71d4701d3b1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "192", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "ed5913fc4b93e9a487a01734da093d1e347007bde6a0b6b6a5f6058eb5f13b4f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cffe10e8-be6e-4b43-ab3a-d01e3a0733c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "77a660a9fcbe2f16f7b09f62c5f618212764b929725401a8ee748fd9e112ba74", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "204 | Standalone financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2020-212.22 Contingent liabilities and commitments\nAccounting policy\nContingent liability is a possible obligation arising from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence \nor non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognized because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability .\nin ` crore\nParticulars As at March 31,\n2021 2020\nContingent liabilities\nClaims against the Company , not acknowledged as debts(1) 3,753  3,410 \n[Amount paid to statutory authorities ` 5,827 crore ( ` 5,229 crore)]\nCommitmentsEstimated amount of contracts remaining to be executed on capital contracts \nand not provided for  609  1,305 \n(net of advances and deposits)\n(2)\nOther commitments* 10  15 \n* Uncalled capital pertaining to investments\n(1) As at March 31, 2021, claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts in respect of income tax matters amounted to ` 3,424 crore.

The group derives \nrevenues from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group\u2019s core and digital offerings and business process management services. The Group assesses the services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. Identification of distinct performance obligations to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables involves significant judgement.\nIn certain integrated services arrangements, contracts with customers include subcontractor services or third-party \nvendor equipment or software. In these types of arrangements, revenue from sales of third-party vendor products or services is recorded net of costs when the Group is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor, and gross when the Group is the principal for the transaction. In doing so, the Group first evaluates whether it controls the products or service before it is transferred to the customer. The Group considers whether it has the primary obligation to fulfil the contract, inventory risk, pricing discretion and other factors to determine whether it controls the products or service and therefore, is acting as a principal or an agent.\nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on (1) a straight-line basis when services are performed \nthrough an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. The use of method to recognize the maintenance revenues requires judgment and is based on the promises in the contract and nature of the deliverables.\nAs certain contracts with customers involve management\u2019s judgment in (1) identifying distinct performance \nobligations, (2) determining whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method, revenue recognition from these judgments were identified as a key audit matter and required a higher extent of audit effort.\nRefer Notes 1.5 and 2.16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAuditor\u2019s ResponsePrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to the (1) identification of distinct performance obligations, (2) determination of \nwhether the Group is acting as a principal or agent and (3) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method included the following, among others:\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to the (a) identification of distinct performance obligations, (b) determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (c) determination of whether fixed price maintenance revenue for certain contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of contracts with customers and performed the following procedures:\n\u2013 Obtained and read contract documents for each selection, including master service agreements, and other \ndocuments that were part of the agreement.\n\u2013 Identified significant terms and deliverables in the contract to assess management\u2019s conclusions regarding the \n(i) identification of distinct performance obligations (ii) whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent and (iii) whether fixed price maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis or using the percentage of completion method", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4072, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0ed4537-571a-48fe-bddb-37c4fb15f33d": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0ed4537-571a-48fe-bddb-37c4fb15f33d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "06c14cf0-0096-4f57-8ba9-70095b0d0b7d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c0be1bbe27a113ba777eb65b606766cf70fd4b85da7162a15f1eddfb2ea73054", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a2d5e93f-8e69-4dae-a5ff-8bcd38c9410c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "203", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "21b1d268d5afe70e0c1c0cec297717d1d258365fe5de3c61fdef4a282032c776", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78a5f7d4-0aaf-4c02-af02-5ea5de3f3018", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ae9a652391faf75b6deec77ff1b9250fdaaa382227c9a0c0800c6e37d6dd1e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Consolidated financial statements | 215 Infosys Annual Report 2020-21Sr. No. Key Audit Matter\n2 Revenue recognition - Fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method \nFixed price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either (1) on a straight-line basis when services are performed \nthrough an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or (2) using a percentage of completion method when the pattern of benefits from services rendered to the customer and the Group\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method.\nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended \nto date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity . The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. Provisions for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nWe identified the estimate of total efforts or costs to complete fixed price contracts measured using the percentage \nof completion method as a key audit matter as the estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. This estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires consideration of progress of the contract, efforts or costs incurred to-date and estimates of efforts or costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations over the term of the contracts.\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating the audit evidence and a higher extent of audit effort \nto evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts.\nRefer Notes 1.5 and 2.16 to the consolidated financial statements\nAuditor\u2019s ResponsePrincipal Audit Procedures Performed\nOur audit procedures related to estimates of total expected costs or efforts to complete for fixed-price contracts \nincluded the following, among others:\n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) recording of efforts or costs incurred and estimation of efforts \nor costs required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording, allocation and budgeting systems which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred.\n\u2022 We selected a sample of fixed price contracts with customers measured the using percentage-of-completion method and performed the following:\n\u2013 Evaluated management\u2019s ability to reasonably estimate the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation by comparing actual efforts or costs incurred to prior year estimates of efforts or costs budgeted for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n\u2013 Compared efforts or costs incurred with Group\u2019s estimate of efforts or costs incurred to date to identify significant \nvariations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining costs or efforts to complete the contract.\n\u2013 Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of delivery of milestones and customer acceptances and sign \noff from customers to identify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated costs or efforts to complete the remaining performance obligations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4032, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "78a5f7d4-0aaf-4c02-af02-5ea5de3f3018": {"__data__": {"id_": "78a5f7d4-0aaf-4c02-af02-5ea5de3f3018", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ec883a5e-065f-46a2-b083-75889438d56d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "205", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "905047782e4274088beda34d2afdb0ef0bf5b3b80c9f0611a13988cb36b58268", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d0ed4537-571a-48fe-bddb-37c4fb15f33d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c0be1bbe27a113ba777eb65b606766cf70fd4b85da7162a15f1eddfb2ea73054", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "30174c9a-0494-406a-9be5-554ad11c92ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "31f0af6c4b8b82b2a1267e7a6f19ad3511d2bfdc9b8dcc5f8f4d3776a040e0e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "216 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2020-21Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor\u2019s Report thereon\nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company\u2019s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the \u201cGuidance Note\u201d) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\u201cICAI\u201d) and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system \nover financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion \non the internal financial controls system over financial reporting of the Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5627, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f63eddb-f72f-4bb2-87a7-91bcf082ed29": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f63eddb-f72f-4bb2-87a7-91bcf082ed29", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "209", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c30eb42-fcd4-4da0-8385-5b796b731b36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "209", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d588426e2a008465868d85982b7421f436b249db6c361247c476e5ce03217dae", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "219d5bfc-553d-4d8d-92f7-1344f1bd3383", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "208", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "1118c4ecf4794efa123b4b1321ab358a38b822eb7a333bc8f31237f1b5ca4219", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c01372f-2887-4915-bbbd-55fac724ebdc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1f74d75689b30591f018e2cd2d7fe45ac76123b011c13fc42b12d0d39e012fa9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "220 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2020-21Opinion\nIn our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company and its subsidiary \ncompanies, which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at/uni00A0March 31, 2021, based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the respective companies considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.\nFor DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS LLP\nChartered Accountants\n(Firm\u2019s Registration No. 117366W/W-100018)\nPlace: MumbaiDate: April 14, 2021Sd/-\nSanjiv V .

Overview\n1.1 Company overview \nInfosys Limited (\u201cthe Company\u201d or Infosys) provides \nconsulting, technology , outsourcing and next-generation digital services, to enable clients to execute strategies for their digital transformation. Infosys\u2019 strategic objective is to build a sustainable organization that remains relevant to the agenda of clients, while creating growth opportunities for employees and generating profitable returns for investors. Infosys\u2019 strategy is to be a navigator for our clients as they ideate, plan and execute on their journey to a digital future. \nInfosys, together with its subsidiaries and controlled trusts, \nis hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Group\u201d.\nThe Company is a public limited company incorporated and \ndomiciled in India and has its registered office at Electronics City , Hosur Road, Bengaluru 560100, Karnataka, India. The/uni00A0Company has its primary listings on BSE Limited and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. The Company\u2019s American Depositary Shares (ADSs) representing equity shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\nThe Group\u2019s Consolidated financial statements are approved for \nissue by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on April 14, 2021.\n1.2 Basis of preparation of financial statements \nThese Consolidated financial statements are prepared in \naccordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS), under the historical cost convention on accrual basis except for certain financial instruments which are measured at fair values, the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) (to the extent notified) and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Act, read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and relevant amendment rules issued thereafter. \nAccounting policies have been consistently applied except \nwhere a newly- issued accounting standard is initially adopted \nor a revision to an existing accounting standard requires a change in the accounting policy hitherto in use. \nAs the year-end figures are taken from the source and rounded \nto the nearest digits, the figures reported for the previous quarters might not always add up to the year-end figures reported in this statement.\n1.3 Basis of consolidation \nInfosys consolidates entities which it owns or controls. The/uni00A0 Consolidated financial statements comprise the financial \nstatements of the Company , its controlled trusts and its subsidiaries, as disclosed in Note 2.23. Control exists when the parent has power over the entity , is exposed, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity . Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the ability to direct relevant activities, those which significantly affect the entity\u2019s returns. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date the control commences until the date control ceases.The financial statements of the Group companies are consolidated on a line-by-line basis and intra-group balances and transactions including unrealized gain / loss from such transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. These financial statements are prepared by applying uniform accounting policies in use at the Group. Non-controlling interests which represent part of the net profit or loss and net assets of subsidiaries that are not, directly or indirectly , owned or controlled by the Company , are excluded.\n1.4 Use of estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of the financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the Management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.5. Accounting estimates could change from period to period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Appropriate changes in estimates are made as the Management becomes aware of changes in circumstances surrounding the estimates. Changes in estimates are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which changes are made and, if material, their effects are disclosed in the notes to the Consolidated financial statements.\nEstimation of uncertainties relating to the global health pandemic from COVID-19 (\"COVID-19\"): \nThe Group has considered the possible effects that may result from the pandemic relating to COVID-19 in the preparation of these Consolidated financial statements including \nthe recoverability of carrying amounts of financial and non- financial assets.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5137, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bf6e6486-bfcd-4a1c-90e8-1b9c7e17f618": {"__data__": {"id_": "bf6e6486-bfcd-4a1c-90e8-1b9c7e17f618", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c0f950f8-df09-4186-a84f-072d9d6fccde", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "80e1c27ef46a4d38db8939b144a0f5c825eab512efbb0534ee8615501920871b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9fb8bb07-e09a-4dd2-b2c3-2d7df6c2aa56", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "221", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "ffc141fdb1b689b82bcad8c53d1590e22c621b6bb8c7673b8dbc23e56f0df173", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2a2f1067-e7b2-4d3b-abeb-b9a651dc0e9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "10174364128e3a21f5478af1d1b09cede5cc541cf301f69f7a7da934064b5275", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Application of accounting policies that require critical accounting estimates involving complex and subjective judgments and the use of assumptions in these financial statements have been disclosed in Note 1.5.

Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the Group to determine the actual efforts or costs expended to date as a proportion of the estimated total efforts or costs to be incurred. Efforts or costs expended have been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity . The estimation of total efforts or costs involves significant judgment and is assessed throughout the period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information.\nProvisions for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted \ncontracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nb. Income taxes \nThe Company\u2019s two major tax jurisdictions are India and the US, though the Company also files tax returns in other overseas jurisdictions. \nSignificant judgments are involved in determining the \nprovision for income taxes, including amount expected to be paid / recovered for uncertain tax positions. Also, refer to Notes 2.15 and 2.22.\nIn assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, \nthe Management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The/uni00A0Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced (refer to Note 2.15).c. Business combinations and intangible assets\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using Ind AS 103, Business Combinations . Ind AS 103 requires the identifiable \nintangible assets and contingent consideration to be fair valued in order to ascertain the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree. Estimates are required to be made in determining the value of contingent consideration, value of option arrangements and intangible assets. These valuations are conducted by external valuation experts. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the Management (refer to Notes 2.1 and 2.3.2).\nd. Property, plant and equipment \nProperty , plant and equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Group. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset\u2019s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of the Group\u2019s assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically , including at each financial year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology (refer to Note 2.2).\ne. Impairment of goodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever there is an indication that the recoverable amount of a cash generating unit (CGU) is less than its carrying amount. For the impairment test, goodwill is allocated to the CGU or groups of CGUs which benefit from the synergies of the acquisition and which represent the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\nThe/uni00A0 recoverable amount of CGUs is determined based \non higher of value-in-use and fair value less cost to sell.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5296, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "357f66c9-5c48-4cd8-8631-7cb23c8425ff": {"__data__": {"id_": "357f66c9-5c48-4cd8-8631-7cb23c8425ff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "222", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "75c45a43-9ddf-4b94-9b7d-45153e4470f4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "222", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "50e7f025f78423bd0467e59afa713288c01bcfd685dba722835ecc88a962d299", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2a2f1067-e7b2-4d3b-abeb-b9a651dc0e9c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "222", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "1326a3dbae5c4fe1ed9844372e01bd542fbc5f702444c77261075477fbfcc707", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0e7e62d-ad8d-4474-a86b-a02845378fb5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a97a4ccd56969224772e392a2e2949b36c3ddf7ea27f271f927f11aafe0262b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The useful lives and residual values of the Group\u2019s assets are determined by the Management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically , including at each financial year end.

The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances.

Allowance for credit losses on receivables and \nunbilled revenue\nThe Group determines the allowance for credit losses based \non historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Group considered current and anticipated future economic conditions relating to industries the Group deals with and the countries where it operates. In calculating expected credit loss, the Group has also considered credit reports and other related credit information for its customers to estimate the probability of default in future and has taken into account estimates of possible effect from the pandemic relating to COVID-19.\n2.1 Business combinations\nAccounting policy\nBusiness combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method under the provisions of Ind AS 103, Business Combinations. \nThe cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the \nassets transferred, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of acquisition, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The cost of acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair value on the date of acquisition. Contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\nThe interest of non-controlling shareholders is initially \nmeasured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests\u2019 proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non- controlling interests\u2019 share of subsequent changes in \nequity of subsidiaries. \nThe payments related to options issued by the Group \nover the non-controlling interests in its subsidiaries are accounted as financial liabilities and initially recognized at the estimated present value of gross obligations.

The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.\nThe changes in the carrying value of property , plant and equipment for the year ended March 31, 2021 are as follows:\nin ` crore\nParticulars Land \u2013 \nFreeholdBuildings \n(1)Plant and \nmachinery Office \nequipment Computer \nequipmentFurniture \nand fixturesLeasehold \nimprovementsVehicles Total\nGross carrying value as at April 1, 2020  1,318  10,016  3,185  1,265  6,676  2,073  1,063  45  25,641 \nAdditions  82  511  117  118  1,159  91  152  1  2,231 \nAdditions \u2013 Business combination  \n(Refer to Note 2.1)  \u2013  \u2013  1  2  4  2  1  \u2013  10 \nDeletions  (1)  \u2013  (10)  (16)  (211)  (19)  (33)  (2)  (292)\nTranslation difference  \u2013  38  3  2  11  2  5  \u2013  61 \nGross carrying value as at March 31, 2021  1,399  10,565  3,296  1,371  7,639  2,149  1,188  44  27,651 \nAccumulated depreciation as at April 1, 2020  \u2013  (3,284)  (2,145)  (934)  (4,885)  (1,380)  (550)  (28)  (13,206)\nDepreciation  \u2013  (386)  (290)  (123)  (954)  (222)  (185)  (6)  (2,166)\nAccumulated depreciation on deletions  \u2013  \u2013  10  15  199  18  33  2  277 \nTranslation difference  \u2013  (5)  \u2013  (1)  4  4  2  \u2013  4 \nAccumulated depreciation as at March 31, 2021  \u2013  (3,675)  (2,425)  (1,043)  (5,636)  (1,580)  (700)  (32)  (15,091)\nCarrying value as at April 1, 2020  1,318  6,732  1,040  331  1,791  693  513  17  12,435 \nCarrying value as at March 31, 2021  1,399  6,890  871  328  2,003  569  488  12  12,560 \nThe changes in the carrying value of property , plant and equipment for the year ended March 31, 2020 were as follows:\nin ` crore\nParticulars Land \u2013 \nFreeholdLand \u2013 \nLeaseholdBuildings \n(1)Plant and \nmachinery Office \nequipment Computer \nequipmentFurniture \nand \nfixturesLeasehold \nimprovementsVehicles Total\nGross carrying value as at April 1, 2019  1,307  605  8,926  2,709  1,101  5,846  1,620  739  38  22,891 \nAdditions  11  \u2013  1,056  475  169  930  465  324  7  3,437 \nAdditions \u2013 Business combination  \n(Refer to Note 2.1)  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  1  62  9  6  \u2013  78 \nDeletions  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  (3)  (8)  (179)  (24)  (18)  (1)  (233)", "start_char_idx": 318, "end_char_idx": 3330, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0fe2553-ad14-4eb0-9825-23b50954eca8": {"__data__": {"id_": "f0fe2553-ad14-4eb0-9825-23b50954eca8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "227", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0ef8bed6-0cee-4d07-a8d6-b73b56e0c4b0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "227", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "f244b2e09eb955a959abf7172eeba01e380178aa13bc163a8bc1dd9f9fbad328", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5e7f014-209f-49cb-97fb-824cbc3f0aa6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "226", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "0c1afb22ab0ecaabcbef69cd6807cf330963283044e68d402fef9217286c6552", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b3614a18-4a5c-4ea0-95c0-6c690fe83226", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "85771306660b6332d02afbaee9d62c598f443d2730a9698c6b5185baa7a160b2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "238 | Consolidated financial statements Infosys Annual Report 2020-21The aggregate depreciation has been included under \ndepreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n2.3 Goodwill and other intangible assets\n2.3.1 Goodwill\nAccounting policy\nGoodwill represents the purchase consideration in excess of \nthe Group\u2019s interest in the net fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity .

The fair value of a CGU is determined based on the market capitalization. Value- in-use \nis determined based on discounted future cash flows. \nThe key assumptions used for the calculations are as follows:\nin %\n Particulars As at March 31,\n 2021  2020\nLong-term growth rate 8-10  7-10 \nOperating margins 19-21 17-20\nDiscount rate 11.7 11.9\nThe above discount rate is based on the Weighted Average \nCost of Capital (WACC) of the Company . As at March/uni00A031, 2021, the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU exceeded its carrying amount. Reasonable sensitivities in key assumptions consequent to the change in estimated future economic conditions on account of possible effects relating to COVID-19 is unlikely to cause the carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount of the cash generating units.2.3.2 Other intangible assets\nAccounting policy\nIntangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated \namortization and impairment. Intangible assets are amortized over their respective individual estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, from the date that they are available for use. The estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset is based on a number of factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors (such as the stability of the industry , and known technological advances). Amortization methods and useful lives are reviewed periodically including at each financial year end.\nResearch costs are expensed as incurred. Software product \ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred unless technical and commercial feasibility of the project is demonstrated, future economic benefits are probable, the Group has an intention and ability to complete and use or sell the software and the costs can be measured reliably . The costs which can be capitalized include the cost of material, direct labour, overhead costs that are directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use.\nImpairment\nIntangible assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.\nIf such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment \nto be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated recoverable amount of the asset. An impairment loss is reversed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. The carrying amount of the asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated amortization) had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset in prior years.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4408, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

India.\n2.10 Financial instruments\nAccounting policy\n2.10.1 Initial recognition\nThe Group recognizes financial assets and financial liabilities \nwhen it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. All financial assets and liabilities are recognized at fair value on initial recognition, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities, that are not at fair value through profit or loss, are added to the fair value on initial recognition. Regular way purchase and sale of financial assets are accounted for at trade date.\n2.10.2 Subsequent measurement\na. Non-derivative financial instruments\n(i) Financial assets carried at amortized cost\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at amortized cost if \nit is held within a business model whose objective is to hold the asset in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n(ii)  Financial assets at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income\nA financial asset is subsequently measured at fair value through other comprehensive income if it is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. The Group has made an irrevocable election for its investments which are classified as equity instruments to present the subsequent changes in fair value in other comprehensive income based on its business model.\n(iii) Financial assets at fair value through profit or lossA financial asset which is not classified in any of the above \ncategories is subsequently fair valued through profit or loss.(iv) Financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are subsequently carried at amortized \ncost using the effective interest method, except for contingent consideration and financial liability under option arrangements recognized in a business combination which is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. For trade and other payables maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date, the carrying amounts approximate the fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\nb. Derivative financial instruments\nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments such as \nforeign exchange forward and options contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency exposures. The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank.\n(i)  Financial assets or financial liabilities, at fair value \nthrough profit or loss\nThis category has derivative financial assets or liabilities which are not designated as hedges.\nAlthough the Group believes that these derivatives constitute \nhedges from an economic perspective, they may not qualify for hedge accounting under Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments. Any/uni00A0 derivative that is either not designated as hedge, or is so designated but is ineffective as per Ind AS 109, is categorized as a financial asset or financial liability , at fair value through profit or loss.\nDerivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially \nat fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, these derivatives are measured at fair value through profit or loss and the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in other income. Assets/uni00A0//uni00A0liabilities in this category are presented as current assets //uni00A0current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realized within 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.\n(ii) Cash flow hedge\nThe Group designates certain foreign exchange forward and \noptions contracts as cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of foreign exchange exposure on highly probable forecast cash transactions.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4959, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a6445567-f1cb-4277-a6e0-4f7bed40ed80": {"__data__": {"id_": "a6445567-f1cb-4277-a6e0-4f7bed40ed80", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "236", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2ef3951f-c592-42d6-af05-c7e7f5ef33df", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "236", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "b430821ab5e15718442f9fcac7f9ef11c5de17de0be259717d86bf5308fce8ca", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "da7666ec-1380-490c-8aa6-a5cf0678009f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "236", "file_name": "infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\infosys-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 5109920, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "487cd5f49955d315132c1e1f6057ca566e4a6c4c2d6400a9beff24ee4c6ca1f7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f7e1ffa9-5587-4f66-8340-f7ad3cafe812", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6d7a2f7d093365ff8d244ad322b40ee6001fbb14e71e6a0d18cfea9ed196d206", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized initially \nat fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss when incurred.

A financial liability (or a part of a financial liability) is derecognized from the Group's Balance Sheet when the obligation specified in the contract \nis discharged or cancelled or expires.\n2.10.4 Fair value of financial instruments\nIn determining the fair value of its financial instruments, \nthe Group uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each reporting date. The methods used to determine fair value include discounted cash flow analysis, available quoted market prices and dealer quotes. All methods of assessing fair value result in general approximation of value, and such value may never actually be realized.\nRefer to table 'Financial instruments by category' below for the \ndisclosure on carrying value and fair value of financial assets and liabilities. For financial assets and liabilities maturing within one year from the Balance Sheet date and which are not carried at fair value, the carrying amounts approximates fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments.\n2.10.5 Impairment \nThe Group recognizes loss allowances using the expected credit loss (ECL) model for the financial assets and unbilled revenue which are not fair valued through profit or loss. Loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues with no significant financing component is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECL. For all other financial assets, ECLs are measured at an amount equal to the 12-month ECL, unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition in which case those are measured at lifetime ECL.

\nCredit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by \nthe counterparty resulting in a financial loss. The maximum exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is primarily from trade receivables amounting to \n` 19,294 crore and \n` 18,487 crore as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, \nrespectively , and unbilled revenues amounting to ` 8,121 \ncrore and ` 7,121 crore as at March 31, 2021 and March 31, \n2020, respectively . Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues from customers primarily located in the US. Credit risk has always been managed by the Group through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Group grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Group uses the expected credit loss model to assess any required allowances; and uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. This matrix takes into account credit reports and other related credit information to the extent available.\nThe Group\u2019s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly \nby the individual characteristic of each customer and the concentration of risk from the top few customers. Exposure to customers is diversified and there is no single customer contributing more than 10% of outstanding trade receivables and unbilled revenues.\nThe details in respect of percentage of revenues generated \nfrom the top customer and the top 10 customers are as follows:\nin %\nParticulars Year ended March 31,\n2021 2020\nRevenue from top customer  3.2  3.1 \nRevenue from top 10 customers  18.1  19.2 \nCredit risk exposure\nThe Group\u2019s credit period generally ranges from 30-75 days.

\nGroup has a present legal or constructive obligation that is reasonably estimable, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time, value of money and the risks specific to the liability .\na. Post-sales client support\nThe Group provides its clients with a fixed-period, post- sales \nsupport on its fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts. Costs/uni00A0 associated with such support services are accrued at the time related revenues are recorded and included in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. The Group estimates such costs based on historical experience and estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis for any material changes in assumptions and likelihood of occurrence.\nb. Onerous contracts\nProvisions for onerous contracts are recognized when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable costs of meeting the future obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.\nThe provision for post-sales client support and other \nprovisions are as follows: \nin ` crore\nParticulars As at March 31,\n2021 2020\nCurrent\nOthers\nPost-sales client support and \nother provisions  713  572 \nTotal provisions  713  572 \nThe movement in the provision for post-sales client support and other provisions is as follows:\nin ` crore\nParticulars Year ended \nMarch 31, 2021\nBalance at the beginning  572 \nProvision recognized / (reversed)  308 \nProvision utilized  (145)\nExchange difference  (22)\nBalance at the end  713 \nProvision for post-sales client support and other provisions represents cost associated with providing post-sales support services which are accrued at the time of recognition of revenues and are expected to be utilized over a period of one year.2.15 Income taxes\nAccounting policy\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred income tax. Income tax expense is recognized in net profit in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity , in which case it is recognized in other comprehensive income. Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognized at the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except when the deferred income tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using \ntax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date and are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of changes in tax rates on deferred income tax assets and liabilities is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment or the substantive enactment date. A/uni00A0deferred income tax asset is recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilized. Deferred income taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries and branches where it is expected that the earnings of the subsidiary or branch will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. \nThe/uni00A0Group offsets current tax assets and current tax liabilities, \nwhere it has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts and where it intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously .

deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority .\nIn assessing the reliability of deferred income tax assets, the \nManagement considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. The/uni00A0Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible, the Management believes that the Group will realize the benefits of those deductible differences. The amount of the deferred income tax assets considered realizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced.\n2.16 Revenue from operations\nAccounting policy\nThe Group derives revenues primarily from IT services comprising software development and related services, maintenance, consulting and package implementation, licensing of software products and platforms across the Group\u2019s core and digital offerings (together called as \u201csoftware related services\u201d) and business process management services. Contracts with customers are either on a time-and-material, unit of work, fixed-price or on a fixed-timeframe basis.\nRevenues from customer contracts are considered for recognition \nand measurement when the contract has been approved by the parties, in writing, to the contract, the parties to the contract are committed to perform their respective obligations under the contract, and the contract is legally enforceable.

When/uni00A0there is uncertainty as to collectability , revenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\nThe Group assesses the services promised in a contract and \nidentifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. The Group allocates the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In the absence of such evidence, the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin, under which the Group estimates the cost of satisfying the performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin based on similar services.\nThe Group\u2019s contracts may include variable consideration \nincluding rebates, volume discounts and penalties. The/uni00A0Group includes variable consideration as part of transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the variable consideration and when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.\nRevenue on time-and-material and unit of work based \ncontracts, are recognized as the related services are performed. Fixed-price maintenance revenue is recognized ratably either on a straight-line basis when services are performed through an indefinite number of repetitive acts over a specified period or ratably using a percentage-of- completion method when the \npattern of benefits from the services rendered to the customer and the Group\u2019s costs to fulfil the contract is not even through the period of contract because the services are generally discrete in nature and not repetitive. Revenue from other fixed-price, fixed-timeframe contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Efforts or costs expended are used to determine progress towards completion as there is a direct relationship between input and productivity . Progress towards completion is measured as the ratio of costs or efforts incurred to date (representing work performed) to the estimated total costs or efforts. Estimates of transaction price and total costs or efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contracts and are recognized in net profit in the period when these estimates change or when the estimates are revised. Revenues and the estimated total costs or efforts are subject to revision as the contract progresses. Provisions for estimated losses, if any , on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated efforts or costs to complete the contract.\nThe billing schedules agreed with customers include periodic \nperformance-based billing and / or milestone-based progress billings. Revenues in excess of billing are classified as unbilled revenue while billing in excess of revenues are classified as contract liabilities (which we refer to as unearned revenues).\nIn arrangements for software development and related \nservices and maintenance services, by applying the revenue recognition criteria for each distinct performance obligation, the arrangements with customers generally meet the criteria for considering software development and related services as distinct performance obligations. For allocating the transaction price, the Group measures the revenue in respect of each performance obligation of a contract at its relative standalone selling price. The price that is regularly charged for an item when sold separately is the best evidence of its standalone selling price. In cases where the Group is unable to determine the standalone selling price, the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. For software development and related services, the performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer generally obtains control of the work as it progresses.\nRevenue from licenses where the customer obtains a \u201cright \nto use\u201d the licenses is recognized at the time the license is made available to the customer. Revenue from licenses where the customer obtains a \u201cright to access\u201d is recognized over the access period.\nArrangements to deliver software products generally have \nthree elements: license, implementation and Annual Technical Services (ATS).When implementation services are provided in conjunction with the licensing arrangement and the license and implementation have been identified as two distinct separate performance obligations, the transaction price for such contracts are allocated to each performance obligation of the contract based on their relative standalone selling prices. In the absence of standalone selling price for implementation, the Group uses the expected cost plus margin approach in estimating the standalone selling price. Where the license is required to be substantially customized as part of the implementation service the entire arrangement fee for license and implementation is considered to be a single performance obligation and the revenue is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method as the implementation is performed.

Amounts are billed as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals (e.g., monthly or quarterly) or upon achievement of contractual milestones.\nThe Group\u2019s receivables are rights to consideration that \nare unconditional. Unbilled revenues comprising revenues in excess of billings from time-and-material contracts and fixed- price maintenance contracts are classified as financial \nassets when the right to consideration is unconditional and is due only after a passage of time. \nInvoicing to the clients for other fixed-price contracts is based \non milestones as defined in the contract and therefore, the timing of revenue recognition is different from the timing of invoicing to the customers. Therefore, unbilled revenues for other fixed-price contracts (contract asset) are classified as non-financial asset because the right to consideration is dependent on completion of contractual milestones. \nInvoicing in excess of earnings are classified/uni00A0as unearned revenue.Trade receivables and unbilled revenues are presented net of \nimpairment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, \nthe Company recognized revenue of \n` 2,489 crore and ` 2,421 \ncrore arising from opening unearned revenue as of April 1, 2020 and April 1, 2019, respectively .\nDuring the years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, \n2020, \n` 3,822 crore and ` 2,971 crore of unbilled revenue \npertaining to other fixed-price and fixed-timeframe contracts as of April 1, 2020 and April 1, 2019, respectively , has been reclassified to trade receivables upon billing to customers on completion of milestones.\nPerformance obligations and remaining performance obligations\nThe remaining performance obligation disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as at the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the Group expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. Applying the practical expedient as given in Ind AS 115, the Group has not disclosed the remaining performance obligation-related disclosures for contracts where the revenue recognized corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity\u2019s performance completed to date, typically those contracts where invoicing is on time -and-material and unit-of-work-based contracts. Remaining performance obligation estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency fluctuations.\nThe aggregate value of performance obligations that are \ncompletely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2021, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria mentioned above, is \n` 69,890 crore. Out of this, the Group expects to recognize \nrevenue of around 50% within the next one year and the remaining thereafter. The aggregate value of performance obligations that are completely or partially unsatisfied as at March 31, 2020 is \n` 55,926 crore.

The Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of a contract. A/uni00A0contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: (i) the contract involves the use of an identified asset; (ii) the Group has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease, and (iii) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\nAt the date of commencement of the lease, the Group \nrecognizes a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short -term leases) and low-value leases. For these short -term \nand low-value leases, the Group recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nCertain lease arrangements includes the options to extend \nor terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU/uni00A0assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. \nThe ROU assets are initially recognized at cost, which \ncomprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.\nROU assets are depreciated from the commencement date \non a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the underlying asset. ROU assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the/uni00A0 recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.\nThe lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at \nthe present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related ROU asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows.\nThe Group as a lessor \nLeases for which the Group is a lessor is classified as a finance or operating lease. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for \nits interests in the head lease and the sublease separately . The sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the ROU asset arising from the head lease.\nFor operating leases, rental income is recognized on a straight \nline basis over the term of the relevant lease.\nTransition\nEffective April 1, 2019, the Group adopted Ind AS 116, Leases  \nusing the modified retrospective method.

Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditure as \nper the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows prepared under the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued \nby the International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIFRS \u201d). Dividend and buyback include applicable taxes. \nIn line with the above Capital Allocation Policy and with an objective of enhancing member returns, the Board, at its meeting \nheld on April 14, 2021, has approved the proposal for recommending buyback of Equity Shares of Maximum Buyback Size \nof up to \u20b9 9,200 crore (Rupees Nine Thousand Two Hundred crore only) as contained in the resolution in this Notice.\nSince the Buyback is more than 10% of the total paid-up equity capital and free reserves of the Company, in terms of \nSection 68(2)(b) of the Act, it is necessary to obtain the consent of the members of the Company, to the Buyback, by way \nof a special resolution. Accordingly, the Company is seeking your consent for the buyback of Equity Shares as contained \nin the special resolution. Requisite details relating to the Buyback are given below.\n1. Necessity for the Buyback\nThe Buyback is being undertaken by the Company after taking into account the strategic and operational cash needs in the \nmedium term and for returning surplus funds to the members in an effective and efficient manner. The Buyback is being \nundertaken for the following reasons:\ni. The Buyback will help the Company to return surplus cash to its members;\nii. The Buyback is generally expected to improve return on equity through distribution of cash and improve earnings per \nshare by reduction in the equity base in the long term, thereby leading to long-term increase in members\u2019 value; and \niii. The Buyback gives an option to the members of the Company, either to sell their Equity Shares and receive cash or \nnot to sell their Equity Shares and get a resultant increase in their percentage shareholding in the Company post the \nBuyback, without additional investment. \n2.
