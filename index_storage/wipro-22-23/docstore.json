This makes it our second consecutive year of \ndouble -digit growth since we began our transformation \njourney in 2020. The Board approved a buyback for the \nvalue of `120\u00a0billion ($1.5 billion) at the price of `445 per \nequity share. This is the biggest buyback in Wipro\u2019s history .\nWe were tested this year by a difficult global \nmacro -economic environment. Even as the pandemic \nreceded, the Ukraine conflict entered a second year and the \nglobal interest rates stayed high. While technology adoption \nas a whole remained secular, in the second half of FY23, \nwe saw some re-prioritization\u2013more cost optimization and \nless discretionary spending\u2013particularly in sectors like BFSI \nand technology. \nOur efficiency and growth-focused solutions allowed us to \nrespond quickly and pertinently to these developments. \nWe ended the year with strong bookings, a growth of 28% \nfrom last year, and hired 22,000 Next-Gen Associates \n(or freshers, as we called them earlier), our highest for a \nsingle year. \nThis year, as in the previous one, we made several major \nstrategic investments, added new capabilities, and grew \nour talent to support future growth. We brought together \nWipro\u2019s entire cloud capability under a fully integrated \nglobal business line (GBL) called Wipro FullStride Cloud, \nwhich accounts for more than a third of our Company\u2019s \nrevenue. We acquired Rizing , a global SAP consulting firm, \nand made significant hires in our cybersecurity practice, \nhelping us create industry-leading applications. On April 1, \n2023, we reorganized ourselves into four global business \nlines \u2013FullStride Cloud, Enterprise Futuring, Engineering \nEdge, and Consulting \u2013to help us align more strongly with \nour clients\u2019 priorities and drive growth in our strategic areas.\nFY23 was a pivotal year for technology, with artificial \nintelligence taking a quantum leap. While we have been long \nfamiliar with AI-powered products (think predictive text, \ndigital personal assistants, chat bots), OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \nand Dall-E brought discussions about the use of generative \nAI emphatically into the public domain.  The next decade, we believe, will be the \nage of AI.

We \nhave been investing ahead of the curve to understand AI \nand leverage its power inside Wipro, and to create solutions \nfor our clients. For two years now, Wipro\u2019s Generative AI \nCenter of Excellence has conducted research with leading \nacademic institutions, built accelerators and solutions, \nframeworks like WeGA (Wipro Enterprise Generative AI), \ndeveloped competency through the Wipro AI Academy, and \nexecuted key pilot programs for our clients. Our AI practice \nhas created several cross-industry solutions, including text \nsummarization and literature mining to synthesize large \namounts of enterprise data, automated code conversion \nfrom legacy to modern languages, and built marketing \naccelerators that generate product descriptions and \nenhance search optimization. \nAs with every emerging technology, AI will impact our \nprofessional, personal, and social life significantly. We are \nputting in strong guardrails and governance models for its \nusage both internally and externally. To us, this position of \nresponsibility is an extension of our Company's strong moral \ncenter and sense of purpose. \nThe most pervasive manifestation of our code is the Spirit \nof Wipro, binding together our employees, customers, \nshareholders, partners, and communities. Our holistic \nview on culture includes five tenets: Leading with purpose, \nsupporting the well-being of our associates, sustaining our \ncommunities, building an inclusive workplace, and nurturing \na mindset that helps us realize our bold ambitions. \nInclusion is a way of life at Wipro. We strive to create and \nsustain a culture that encourages authenticity and offers \na safe space for all 250,000+ of our employees. Thanks to \nour sustained efforts, gender diversity at senior leadership \nlevels has seen a three-fold increase and has gone up to \n17% at present. In the US, the Disability Alliance Network, \nan employee resource group, is accelerating our inclusion \nefforts and building welcoming spaces for all our associates. \nLast year, we observed Transgender Awareness Week and \nTransgender Day of Visibility.\nAs with our people, at Wipro, we believe that engagement \nwith social and environmental issues must be deep, \nmeaningful, and a long-term commitment.With weather cycles continuing to upset predictable patterns \nacross the world, climate change becomes a more urgent \nissue every day. As a result of our decade-plus commitment \nto battling the challenge, our ESG programs are central \nto what we do as a business today. Our track record and \nexpertise in sustainability solutions have opened up new \navenues for us in Consulting, Cloud, ESG Analytics and \nReporting; we expect significant traction on this front in the \nnext two years. \nMultiple initiatives are taking us closer to our stated goal \nof Net Zero GHG emissions by 2040. In the past year, we \novershot our targets of reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. \nSixty percent of our owned facilities now use renewable \nenergy. Our annual business travel is down to 305 million km, \nagainst a goal of 595 million km. We will continue to invest in \nsolutions and behavioral change to reach our targets even as \ntravel rebounds and office occupancy increases. Our efforts \nwere recognized by the DJSI (World) for the 13th\u00a0consecutive \ntime ; we were also rated \u2018Gold\u2019 in the EcoVadis rating \nframework and included in CDP\u2019s A list of 200 global \ncompanies with demonstrated climate leadership. \nThrough the Wipro Foundation, we continue to augment our \nwork in education, healthcare, and urban ecology in India. \nOutside of India, we launched a recalibrated grants program, \ndriven largely by the local chapter and leadership in six \ngeographies around the world. \nIn closing, let me express my deep gratitude to our clients, \npartners, employees, and other stakeholders who have \nplaced their trust and confidence in us.

In fact, we closed FY23 with \ntwo consecutive quarters of record bookings , despite \na\u00a0gradually softening business environment. \nOur focus has been on building an agile, high-performance, \ncustomer-centric culture, one that incentivizes delivering \noutstanding solutions and customer experience. As a result, \nin the past year, Wipro has won larger and more complex \ndeals, and we are increasingly becoming the preferred \nlong -term partner for clients\u2019 transformation needs. \nThis is a reflection of our clients\u2019 confidence in our \ncapabilities, culture, and delivery. It\u2019s also a result of the \nstrategic investments we have made in high-growth areas \nsuch as Cloud, Data and AI, Cybersecurity, and Engineering. \nTo stay ahead in the Generative AI space, we scaled our AI \nCenter of Excellence, partnered with several leading GenAI \nproviders and academia for research and development, and \ninvested in AI pilots to build our own foundational models. \nWe made significant investments in talent, both organically \nand inorganically. In addition to leadership changes, we \nhired 22,000 Next-Gen Associates  last year (or freshers, \nas we called them in the past), the highest addition for a \nsingle year. By most accounts, we closed FY23 at a \nsignificantly improved place. We are stronger \noperationally, and taking a more futuristic \napproach to solutions. \nWe have the growth mindset, and the right \norganizational structure and talent \u2013 giving us \nthe resiliency for long\u2011term success.\nAmbitions Realized .\n  \n18\nReporting Context Our Capabilities Governance and Leadership Performance Overview", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2230, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "df5f4ae8-d9ae-4475-bdfb-c6420876409b": {"__data__": {"id_": "df5f4ae8-d9ae-4475-bdfb-c6420876409b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "47f5d3b4-49bf-4358-ad7b-ac9651735587", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e8ef8e2d14a9e730e27ffc442279452f3181a6e6e6fe121672301874862256fa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e704dff7-ebc0-4954-8e21-a47311fae080", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "b36111649211a1b941b7940bc230edbe40e1e67037dd8eeb790fef8fd85b6cac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "63b09201-ab8c-43a6-a666-60a8b3e7623d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "22d9b5631d888cf4f8bfef00f517b01f6debafd681377bf9bdde61a07731239a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Simultaneously, our operating model evolved to better \nserve our fast-growing business.

It also simplifies \nhow we orchestrate internally and across our ecosystem to \ndeliver for clients.\nFY23: A YEAR OF STRONG BOOKINGS AND \nDOUBLE -DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH\nFor the full year, we reported revenues of $11.2 billion , which \nrepresents an 11.5% growth in constant currency terms, and \nan addition of $800 million in revenues for the year. \nOrder bookings  in Total Contract Value terms grew 28% \nYoY ; we finished the year with two consecutive quarters of \nbookings of over $4.1 billion each. We signed 55 large deals  \nwith a total contract value of $3.9 billion , growing 66.5% YoY . \nOur IT services operating profits were at their highest ever, \nin\u00a0absolute terms. \nBookings TCV with Hypergrowth Partners in FY23 continued \nto be strong. Overall, in last three years, the share of partner \nbookings as a percentage of our total bookings rose from \n25% to 44% in FY23. We had a robust cash conversion of \n`110.8 billion , which is 114.9% of net income . \nWe also announced a share buyback in April 2023, with the \naim of delivering consistent returns to you, our shareholders. \nThis buyback, of `120 billion , is the biggest ever buyback \noffered in Wipro\u2019s history.\nRESPONSIBLE BUSINESS, ALWAYS \nOur accomplishments are not merely measured in numbers \nor financial metrics. They are reflected in the lives we \nhave touched, the communities we have empowered, and \nthe positive change we have fostered. The impact of our \ntechnologies, solutions, and social initiatives extends far \nbeyond the walls of our Company. It resonates in the lives of \nindividuals who work with us, and in the advancement of the \nsocieties we do business in.

With central \nbanks raising interest rates and food and energy prices \ncoming down, global inflation is gradually subsiding. This \nhas resulted in marginal improvement in business and \nhousehold buying power. \nThe near-term outlook remains highly uncertain with \ndownside risks from the unpredictable course of the \ngeopolitical conflict in Europe, continued impact from \ntighter monetary policy, inflation and recession fears, \npressures in global energy markets reappearing, and \nfinancial market volatility. Rapid tightening of fiscal \npolicies has exposed vulnerabilities both among banks \nand non-bank financial institutions, with fluctuations in \nfinancial conditions due to shifts in market sentiment. \nThis may result in slowdown in demand in certain markets \nand lead to delayed decision making.\nTechnology spending is forecasted to increase with \nenterprises investing in value-driven transformation \nfocused on areas like cloud transformation, automation, \nintegration of AI, data analytics and cyber security as \ntheir top priorities. The demand for digital transformation \nand infrastructure modernization will continue to drive \ngrowth for the industry with accelerated adoption \nof digital and emerging technologies, such as next \ngeneration AI, augmented reality ( \u201cAR\u201d ), virtual reality \n(\u201cVR\u201d ), extended reality, web3 and metaverse, 5G \nand edge, cyber and bio convergence. While emerging \ntechnologies will disrupt industries, they will also pose \nnew risks in the areas of data privacy, surveillance \nand ownership.\nGlobal IT service providers are equipped to support \nenterprises across various industries to overcome the \ncurrent challenges, with a wide range of offerings in \nsoftware development, digital transformation, IT business \nsolutions and consulting, research and development, \ntechnology infrastructure and business process services.\nThe IT services industry is expected to accelerate and \ndrive decisions in fiscal year 2024 based on investments made by clients in cost optimization, operational excellence, \ndigital transformation, vendor consolidation, productivity \nimprovement, customer experience programs, innovation \nin products and services, talent management, future of \nworkplace and workforce, and environmental, social, and \ngovernance initiatives.\nAccording to the Strategic Review 2023 published by \nNASSCOM ( \u201cNASSCOM Report\u201d ), revenue for the Indian \nIT services\u2019 sector is expected to witness growth of 8.3% \nyear-on-year in fiscal year 2023, led by IT modernization \nincluding application modernization, cloud migration \nand platformization. Digital revenues are estimated to \naccount for 32%-34% of total industry revenue, growing \nat 16% annually in fiscal year 2023.

Our IT Services segment \nrevenue increased by 14.8%. The revenue for all SMUs grew \nduring the year. The growth was led by a surge in demand \nfor IT services by our customers, consummation of our \nacquisitions, ramp up of our new deal wins, including large \ndeals, and depreciation of the Indian Rupee against foreign \ncurrencies, including the USD and Canadian Dollar.\nRevenue of the IT Products segment declined by 2.0%, which \nwas primarily due to our focus on providing IT products as a \ncomplement to our IT services offerings, rather than selling \nstandalone IT products and our adoption of a more selective \napproach in bidding for SI engagements. Revenue of the \nISRE segment declined by 20.2%, which was primarily due \nto the completion of certain large SI deals during the year \nended March 31, 2022.\nEffective April 1, 2023, we will be once again merging ISRE \nsegment with our IT Services segment, as we have aligned \nthe sales strategy for GoI and/or ISRE customer to that \nof the larger IT services segment and shifted focus to our \nbroader service offerings including digital transformation, \ncybersecurity, engineering services and consulting \nservices. Further, the projects with longer gestation periods \nand higher balance sheet investments have since been \nsignificantly completed, closed or ramped down. \nAs a result of our strategy with respect to SI projects, and \nincreasing emphasis on consulting and digital engagements \ninstead, our ISRE and IT Services segments now have similar \nsales cycles, billing and collection processes.\nCost of revenues\nIn absolute terms, cost of revenues increased by 16.1%, \nprimarily due to an increase in employee compensation due \nto the impact of salary increases, including promotions, \nand increase in headcount, including through acquisitions, incremental sub-contracting costs incurred to fulfil vacant \npositions, increase in travel expenses as travel restrictions \nrelated to COVID-19 eased and increase in software \nlicense expenses.\nSelling and marketing expenses\nOur selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total \nrevenue increased from 6.9% for the year ended March\u00a031, \n2022 to 7 .2% for the year ended March\u00a031, 2023. In absolute \nterms, selling and marketing expenses increased by 18.6%, \nprimarily because of the increase in employee compensation \ndue to the impact of salary increases, including promotions, \nand increase in sales headcount, incremental amortization \nof intangibles recognized on acquisitions consummated \nduring the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, increase in \ntravel expenses as client return to offices, and increase in \nmarketing and brand building expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses as a percentage of \nrevenue increased from 5.8% for the year ended March\u00a031, \n2022 to 6.5% for the year ended March\u00a031, 2023.

The decline was \nprimarily due to our focus on providing IT products as a \ncomplement to our IT services offerings, rather than selling standalone IT products, and our adoption of a more selective \napproach in bidding for SI engagements. Our gross profit as \na percentage of our IT Products segment revenue decreased \nby 184bps.

We continually \nmonitor our funding requirements, and strategies are \nexecuted to maintain sufficient flexibility to access global \nfunding sources, as needed. As of March\u00a031, 2023, we \nhad contractual commitments of B7 ,675\u00a0million ($93.4 \nmillion) related to capital expenditures on construction \nor expansion of software development facilities and \nB37 ,805 million ($460.0 million) related to other purchase \nobligations. Plans to construct or expand our software \ndevelopment facilities are determined by our business \nrequirements. As discussed above, cash generated from \noperations is our primary source of liquidity. We believe \nthat our cash and cash equivalents along with cash \ngenerated from operations will be sufficient to meet \nour working capital requirements as well as repayment \nobligations with respect to debt and borrowings. Our \nchoices of sources of funding will be driven with the \nobjective of maintaining an optimal capital structure. We \nwill rely on funds generated from operations and external \ndebt to fund potential acquisitions and shareholder \nreturns. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, \ninvestments in short-term mutual funds and the cash \nflows expected to be generated from our operations in \nthe future will generally be sufficient to fund the growth \naspirations, as applicable. \nIn the normal course of business, we transfer certain \naccounts receivables, unbilled receivables and net \ninvestment in finance lease (financial assets) to banks \non a non-recourse basis.

In addition, we have \nunutilized credit lines in various currencies aggregating to \nB54,230 million as of March 31, 2023. To utilize these lines of \ncredit, we require the consent of the lender and compliance \nwith certain financial covenants.

Besides, changes to \nthese incentives and other exemptions, we receive due to \ngovernment policies can impact our financial performance. \nForeign currency risk\nWe operate internationally and a major portion of our \nbusiness is transacted in several currencies. The exchange \nrate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, \nreceivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables \nand foreign currency loans and borrowings. Mitigation plan\n\u2022 Most of our taxes paid in countries other than India can be applied as a \ncredit against our Indian tax liability to the extent that the same income is \nsubject to taxation in India. \n\u2022 Currently, we benefit from certain tax incentives under Indian tax laws \nincluding tax holiday from payment of Indian corporate income taxes for our \nbusinesses operating from SEZs.\nMitigation plan\n\u2022 We evaluate our exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and \nenter into foreign currency derivative instruments to mitigate such exposure.\n\u2022 We follow established risk management policies, including the use of \nderivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge \nforecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency. \n\u2022 We designate certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to \nmitigate the foreign exchange exposure of forecasted highly probable cash \nflows. Periodically, we may also designate foreign currency denominated \nborrowings as a hedge of net investment in foreign operations.\nWage pressure\nOur wage costs in India have historically been significantly \nlower than wage costs in the US and Europe for comparably \nskilled professionals, and this has been one of our \ncompetitive advantages. However, wage increases in India \nmay prevent us from sustaining this competitive advantage \nand may negatively affect our profit margins. \nCredit risk\nCredit risk arises from the possibility that customers may \nnot be able to settle their obligations as agreed. Mitigation plan\n\u2022 We may need to increase our employee compensation more rapidly than in \nthe past to retain talent. Once the effective date is notified by the GoI, we may \nalso experience increased costs in future years for employment and post-\nemployment benefits in India as a result of the issuance of The Code on Social \nSecurity, 2020.\nMitigation plan\n\u2022 We periodically assess the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, \nconsidering the financial condition, current economic trends, forward-\nlooking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and \nageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly.\n\u2022 No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts \nreceivable as of March\u00a031, 2023 or revenues for the year ended March\u00a031, \n2023. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.\nInterest rate risk\nInterest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate \nborrowing, including various revolving and other lines \nof credit.Mitigation plan\n\u2022 The investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not \nexpose it to significant interest rate risk.\n\u2022 We have taken certain interest rate swaps against its investments in floating \nrate instruments. Periodically, we manages its net exposure to interest rate \nrisk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, \nwhich allows us to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount \nand agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates.\nAmbitions Realized .\n  \n52\nReporting Context Our Capabilities Governance and Leadership Performance Overview", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3754, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9afe2f45-d267-4282-b797-b065705d3725": {"__data__": {"id_": "9afe2f45-d267-4282-b797-b065705d3725", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e5a95c58-7074-40b9-9fcc-dd26d1dfc928", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "7aa112b5cf1f1106ac5158c5d186046f8d4b81ab646ec2c94b97d96580de4f30", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c8f709d5-bb86-4ea0-ab97-9de6161f087d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "8afbde34501d8e58b2a35e88a1d46d33c84fffa963c9c841eece7f28220a3ed1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b572851b-92b7-451e-8996-b3dbaac3644b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3403aeb52d0469914ff80c99a0f29ec57578be7fbdae2ff02b1140782c080fe1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "SHAREHOLDER RETURNS\nCash dividends\nThe cash dividend paid during the year ended March\u00a031, \n2022 was an interim dividend of B1 per equity share.

Our programs encompass three areas of \nemployee well-being: Physical, emotional, and financial.\nPhysical well-being\nSitting for long periods of time can lead to discomfort, \nfatigue, and even injury. Poor posture, repetitive \nmovements, and awkward positions can cause \nmusculoskeletal disorders such as back pain, neck pain, \nand carpal tunnel syndrome. To address these issues, \nit is important to provide employees with an ergonomic \nworkspace and encourage them to take regular breaks to \nstretch and move around throughout the day.\nAs we assessed risks in the post-pandemic hybrid world, \nand understood the importance of incorporating these \npractices, we introduced an ergonomic tool called Stretch \nand Pause under the Wipro Well-being initiative.

We conduct \nannual sessions on anti-bribery and anti-corruption to \nidentify high-risk geographies and social compliance \nprograms for manpower services providers.\nWipro follows a Vendor Risk Assessment policy to \nensure Information security assessments of critical \nsuppliers/vendors align with applicable policies, \nprocedures, standards, and baselines. We utilize a \nsecurity questionnaire based on industry frameworks \nlike ISO 27001 and NIST 800-53 to evaluate vendor \nsecurity controls. Assessment reports, approved by \nrelevant stakeholders, highlight non-conformances \nand observations. We track and address these \nobservations to achieve closure effectively.

However, over the \nlast century, the pace of change in Earth\u2019s climate has \nincreased exponentially due to rapid industrialization \nand consumption of fossil fuel-derived products and \nservices, resulting in heatwaves, changing rainfall \npatterns, delayed winters, early summers, rising \nsea levels, increasing water stress, and tropical \ndiseases. Due to existing inequalities and inequities, \nadapting to climate change is harder for the most \nvulnerable. The possibility of reversing the impact of \nclimate change seems increasingly remote. However, \nimmediate actions would reduce the probability of its \nworst repercussions. \nAccording to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange's (IPCC) most recent assessment report, in \norder to keep the global temperature rise below 1.5\u00b0C, \nrising emissions observed over the last century needs \nto stop by 2025. This can be achieved only through \nimmediate emission reduction wherever possible. \nOver the past few years, we are seeing a groundswell \nof commitment towards mitigating and adapting to \nclimate change by businesses with nearly 15,000 \ncompanies today disclosing through the Climate \nDisclosure Project.  Climate change will impact all sectors of the \neconomy, though there will be significant sectoral \nand geographical variations.

Service sector \norganizations located in urban centers such as Wipro \ncould be impacted. \nWe endorse the Paris Agreement and the goal of \nlimiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial \nlevels.

The strategy is reviewed \nannually by the CEO and the Chief Sustainability \nOfficer, while progress against the strategy is \nreviewed quarterly.\n\u2022 Climate-related issues concerning the \norganization\u2019s progress against energy \nand emissions targets for the short-term, \nmedium -term, and long-term are monitored by \nour Chief Sustainability Officer and the Head of \nGlobal Operations.Monitoring and management of climate-\nrelated issues across the organization\nAll the key organizational stakeholders are entrusted with \nvarious responsibilities relating to planning, executing, \nevangelizing, and advocating our Company\u2019s sustainability \nagenda. Our senior leadership and key functions like the \nFacilities Management Group, Infrastructure Creation \nGroup, Sustainability Office, Human Resources, Finance, \nand Risk Office are responsible for planning and review, \ninternal evangelizing, and external advocacy. The Facilities \nManagement Group and Infrastructure Creation Group are key \nstakeholders responsible for implementation while Employee \nChapters take an active interest in delivering location-level \ncommunity initiatives. Over the years, we have developed a \ncomprehensive inventory of our GHG emissions across our \nvalue chain. Our participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project \n(CDP) Climate Change Investor and Supply Chain modules for \nover 15 years has aided in this process.\nIn addition, we apply the Natural Capital Protocol guidelines \nto arrive at the valuation of our natural capital (NCV) that we \npublish in our annual Environmental Profit & Loss account. \nAmbitions Realized .\n  \n84\nReporting Context Our Capabilities Governance and Leadership Performance Overview", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4340, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5079996-d6cb-4793-8e23-dcd55a77b110": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5079996-d6cb-4793-8e23-dcd55a77b110", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7d66c72f-3408-4ce1-8ed0-6c229c00577a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "66d91ba8e9e565d2f676f8438109225576910d78e4a1b728c4fe62efbbe2c45d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "37df8370-6162-4310-b041-6eac4e1673fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "75", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "fe0a87c628df5fe5ca8a82ca2d2a7a8d488157134676354625255f8aa379daea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "50e7e898-a2dc-47be-a36f-25ee48da2f47", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0612564154e7423f7a2996767119a3ed0d2ffb61a2dfaae6e1843948f1f2c392", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ENVIRONMENTAL RISKS,  \nIMPACTS AND ASSESSMENT\nThe Enterprise Risk Management and Sustainability \nfunctions at Wipro jointly oversee environmental and \nclimate change-related risk identification and mitigation. \nIn 2020, to address our physical climate-related issues, we \nconducted an analysis based on probable risk scenarios \nusing the intermediate and business-as-usual scenarios, \nbased on the IPCC Representative Concentration \nPathways 4.5 and 8.5 to understand the medium to long-\nterm effects of acute and chronic physical hazards on our \nglobally spread facilities, data centers, and supply chain. \nThese evaluations provide insights assisting our \noperational strategy and identifying critical opportunities \nto incorporate climate-related concerns into our long-term \nresiliency plan.

The current round of small \ngrants focuses on promoting wetland literacy among \nChennai\u2019s youth using Toxic, Climate and Water Tours through the Construction of 3 deep aquifer recharge \nwells in Little Flower Convent to tackle local flooding. \nIt also includes creation of a community garden in \nKasturba Nagar to support urban biodiversity and uniting \nurban neighborhoods.\nIn Hyderabad, we are putting together a knowledge \nrepository of water in the city\u2013consumption, sources, water \nbodies, built infrastructure, and impacts on water flows. \nIn\u00a0FY24 we aim to support 6 community design intervention \nprojects with a focus on urban ecological issues. \nThe annual urban waters workshop was organized in \nMarch 2023 and brought together more than 60 urban \nwater practitioners across the country for a 2-day event \nin Bengaluru.\nUrban Biodiversity\nThe twin primary aims of our campus urban biodiversity \nprogram have been to convert our existing campuses into \nbiodiversity zones and to develop them as platforms for \nwider education and advocacy, both within our organization \nand outside.\nOur biodiversity projects integrate multiple benefits of water \nconservation, ambient temperature reduction, air pollution \nmitigation, and employee engagement. We started our first \ncampus biodiversity program in Bengaluru with a Butterfly \nPark in 2013.\nWe have integrated various ecosystem and educational \naspects in our later projects\u2013Wetland Park in Bengaluru \nand a multi-thematic biodiversity project in Pune, both \ncompleted in 2019. We have now started work on a unique \n40-acre reserve for endemic Eastern Ghats species in \nHyderabad. Ex-situ conservation is one of the recommended \nmethods to ensure the preservation of vanishing and \nthreatened species and to maintain genetic diversity. \nOur biodiversity projects integrate multiple \nbenefits of water conservation, ambient \ntemperature reduction, air pollution mitigation, \nand employee engagement.

In addition, some categories of waste like \nelectronic waste, batteries, and mixed metals generated \nin the previous year were disposed. \n\u2022 E-waste disposal has had a notable increase due to \ne-waste which were disposed of pre-COVID-19. Also, \nrapid technological advancement has attributed to \nthe disposal of obsolete technology and devices.\n\u2022 The construction debris has also seen an increase \nbecause of the HVAC pipe replacement.\n\u2022 We monitor diesel generator stack emissions (NOx, \nSOx, and SPM), indoor air quality (CO, CO2, VOCs, \nRSPM), treated water quality, and ambient noise \nlevels across 25 key locations every month. All of \nthese meet the specified regulatory norms.\n\u2022 For the reporting year, our safe disposal rate was \n97%, i.e., 3% of waste was landfilled (excluding \nconstruction and demolition debris).Managing these \u2018commons\u2019 in an urban context requires \nbusiness organizations to look beyond their own \nboundaries and adopt an integrated approach.\nOur waste management goals\n100% of organic waste generated from business operations is recycled for effective reuse.

Wipro emphasizes recycling and encourages the \nuse of recycled materials wherever feasible. Wipro collaborates \nwith authorized recycling partners to manage electronic \nwaste (e-waste) responsibly, ensuring compliance with \nrelevant regulations.\nWaste collection and disposal\nWipro collaborates with authorized waste management service \nproviders to collect and dispose of different types of waste \nsafely. Wipro ensures that these service providers comply with \nrelevant regulations and possess the necessary licenses and \npermits. Waste collection is done systematically, adhering to \npredefined schedules and routes to optimize efficiency.\nWaste segregation\nWipro follows a stringent waste segregation process at its \nfacilities. Employees are educated and encouraged to segregate \nwaste at the source into different categories such as recyclable, \nnon-recyclable, hazardous, and organic waste. This segregation \nhelps streamline the disposal process and enables efficient \nrecycling and treatment of waste.\nTracking and reporting\nWipro maintains comprehensive records and documentation \nrelated to waste generation, segregation, collection, and \ndisposal.

Natural Capital Impacts are \ncalculated across six key performance indicators (KPIs) \nnamely, GHG emissions, air pollution, water consumption, \nwater and land pollution, waste generation, and land use \nchange. The methodology uses a value for the social cost \nof carbon that varies by country and geography. Typically, \nit uses a higher discount rate for developing countries as \ncompared to developed countries, given that the former \nneeds more \u2018ecological space\u2019 and time to fulfill their \ndevelopmental imperatives.\nA note on the methodology: For calculating impacts due to air \npollution only human health Impacts were considered as they \ncontribute to 95% of the total impact from air pollution. Land \nuse valuation was based on net change in economic value \ndue to loss of ecosystem service and was calculated only for \nthe electricity procured from the grid mix, since for the direct \noperations, land use change is not considered to be material. \nFor calculating the impact due to water consumption, the \nfollowing factors were taken into consideration\u2013impact \non human health, the incidence of infectious disease, and \nimpact of energy consumption.\nIn FY23, the total environmental costs related to Wipro\u2019s \noperations and supply chain were quantified at $0.28 billion \n($0.32 billion in FY22), of which operational and supply chain \nimpacts contribute 4% ($12 million) and 97% ($270 million) \nrespectively. One of the main reasons for the decrease in the \nvaluation is the recalculation of purchased goods & services \nfor FY22. Of the operational impacts, the highest contribution \nis from electricity consumption at 77% ($9.3 million). Within \nWipro\u2019s upstream supply chain, purchased goods and \nservices across all tiers of suppliers (85%; $230 million) \nand fuel and energy related activities (10%; $27 million) are \nthe top two impact categories. In terms of the sources of \nimpact, air pollution (68%; $190 million), and greenhouse gas \nemissions (22%; $62 million) are the top two contributors.\n95\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Value Creation for Stakeholders Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4830, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86d4d034-99db-4793-9f64-7095326e4b1d": {"__data__": {"id_": "86d4d034-99db-4793-9f64-7095326e4b1d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42d7fcc1-6b67-4f97-97d3-bac1ebc0bb2c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "f40a7aaabddc49273a96086da1ae4bfe366e4fac2de047f9cf5273f42a618690", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8e5e4eae-a6a4-4d66-aded-9ef4bf89a195", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "7526ce111815cc3713c8329729e7286a7211dfff16d01ae1c9eb49c4166ede8e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dd9987fb-067a-47e0-a224-785cabcd522e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "366c5edfce1456c14b19372e101d91e2188951be25572c15e0d06d8429e569a0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Board\u2019s Report\nDear Members,\nIt gives me immense pleasure to present the 77th Board\u2019s \nReport, on behalf of the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d ) of \nthe Company, along with the Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss \naccount and Cash Flow statements, for the financial year \nended March 31, 2023.\nI.

The MRE excluding WTDs was H 899,571 and H 793,086 in financial year 2022-23 and 2021-22 respectively. The increase in \nMRE excluding the WTDs in financial year 2022-23 as compared to financial year 2021-22 is 13.43%.\n2.  The MRE including WTDs was H 899,571 and H 793,086 in financial year 2022-23 and 2021-22 respectively. The increase in \nMRE including the WTDs in financial year 2022-23 as compared to financial year 2021-22 is 13.43%.\n3.  The number of permanent employees on the rolls of the Company as of March 31, 2023, and March 31, 2022, was 248,813 \nand 236,204 respectively.\n4.  The aggregate remuneration of employees excluding WTD grew by 1.25% over the previous financial year, attributed to \nthe increase in headcount. The aggregate decrease in salary for WTDs and other KMPs was 6.16% in financial year 2022-\n23 over financial year 2021-22, on account of the following: \n a)  The Company determined that no commission was payable for financial year 2022-23 to Mr. Rishad A. Premji \nconsidering that the incremental consolidated net profits for financial year 2022-23 was negative.\n b)  Reduction in variable pay and RSU amortization cost for Mr. Jatin Pravinchandra Dalal, in line with performance \nparameters of the Company. \n5.  Company affirms that the remuneration is paid as per the remuneration policy of the Company.\nVariable Pay Compensation\nThe variable pay of executive officers, including the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, is based on clearly laid \nout criteria and measures, which are linked to the desired performance and business objectives of the organization. The \ncriteria for variable pay, which is paid out quarterly/annually, includes financial parameters like revenue, profit achievement, \noperating margin achievement and other strategic goals as decided by the Board, from time to time.\nApart from the variable pay component, long term (typically greater than one year) incentives granted to executive officers, \nincluding the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, includes both time-based stock units (RSUs) and performance-\nbased stock units (PSUs).\nThe vesting of PSUs is based on performance parameters of the Company over a defined performance period and is linked to \npredefined financial goals. Time-based stock units typically vest over a defined period. The vesting pattern and schedule for \nboth these types of stock units are as determined by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee.\n109\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Value Creation for Stakeholders Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2584, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "16993225-d135-414c-b205-794717ffabc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "16993225-d135-414c-b205-794717ffabc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "74cb61aa-6c35-490e-ad0a-db47218d88a6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "101", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "cd3fb454f432ebb80c86963596bf3951739eab1a5dcb8cc8b9c181ded18e7e9d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3e3e2567-4ad9-4a09-89b3-fdb033ea52b2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "100", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "7436e1c0e5b3eb2ebb59f0901610215740ae0aeed165b66e3e5555dfb1ea4491", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7a6d642-3651-421e-827b-9311b104fc6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "715650ea3a99ef48e7db8216486fa7aed4d8e535497e5470384a4e04f75369f2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ANNEXURE II\nInformation as per Rule 5(2) of the Companies (Appointment and Remuneration of Managerial Personnel) Rules, 2014\nA)\t Top\t10\temployees\tin\tterms\tof\tsalary\tdrawn\tduring\tthe\tfinancial\tyear\t2022-23\nSl. \nNo.Name of the EmployeeDate of joining \n(DD-MM-YYYY)Gross \nRemuneration \n(in D)Qualification AgeExperience \n(yrs)Last Employment Designation\n1 Thierry Delaporte#* 06-07-2020  824,114,292 Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Economy \nand Finance, Masters in Law56 28 Capgemini Chief Executive Officer  \nand Managing Director\n2 Rishad A.

WIPRO\u2019S PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n  Wipro\u2019s governance framework is driven by the objective of enhancing long term stakeholder value without compromising \non ethical standards and corporate social responsibilities. We also strive to ensure balance between our aims and \nminority rights in all our business decisions. Efficient corporate governance requires a clear understanding of the \nrespective roles of the Board and of  Senior Management and their relationships with others in the corporate structure. \nSincerity, fairness, good citizenship, and commitment to compliance are key characteristics that drive relationships of \nthe Board and Senior Management with other stakeholders.\n  Wipro\u2019s Corporate Governance philosophy flows from the \u201cSpirit of Wipro\u201d that represents the core values by which \npolicies and practices of the organization are guided. The spirit is deeply rooted in the unchanging essence of Wipro. But \nit also embraces what we must aspire to be. It gives us direction and a clear sense of purpose. Our brand identity reflects \nthe Spirit of Wipro. Our core values have remained constant, though our Company has transformed many times over \nthe years.\n  In addition, our Chairman introduced the Five Habits essential to drive a Growth Mindset in early 2020, which are our \nvalues in action. Five Habits is our culture transformation initiative. With this initiative, your Company encourages its \nleaders to exemplify the fundamental behaviours aligned to each of the Five Habits. Your Company believes that its \nleaders will be the most visible examples of its culture. They are encouraged to be great role models for their teams, \nas the Company cascades this message further. Your Company believes that this change is intrinsically personal and \ngreatly driven by an individual\u2019s will to be open to learning through life. \n  The values encapsulated in the \u201cSpirit of Wipro\u201d and \u201cFive Habits\u201d are:\n  So far, over 32,000 leaders and 165,000 employees \nglobally have been part of 106 immersive and interactive \nsessions hosted by our senior leadership team on the \nFive Habits.

Our \nresponsibilities under those Standards are further described \nin the Auditor\u2019s Responsibility for the Audit of the Standalone \nFinancial Statements section of our report. We are \nindependent of the Company in accordance with the Code \nof Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants \nof India (the \u201cICAI\u201d) together with the ethical requirements \nthat are relevant to our audit of the Standalone Financial \nStatements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules \nmade thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical \nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements and \nthe ICAI\u2019s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence \nobtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a \nbasis for our audit opinion on the Standalone Financial  \nStatements. KEY AUDIT MATTER\nKey audit matter is a matter that, in our professional \njudgment, is of most significance in our audit of the \nStandalone Financial Statements of the current period. \nThis matter was addressed in the context of our audit of \nthe Standalone Financial Statements as a whole, and \nin forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a \nseparate opinion on this matter. We have determined the \nmatter described below to be the key audit matter to be \ncommunicated in our report.\nRevenue from fixed-price contracts using the percentage-\nof-completion method - Refer Notes 2 (iii)(a), 3(xiii)B and 22 \nto the financial statements.\nKey Audit Matter Description\nRevenue from fixed-price contracts, including software \ndevelopment, and integration contracts, where the \nperformance obligations are satisfied over time, is \nrecognized using the percentage-of-completion method. \nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the \nCompany to determine the project costs incurred to date as \na percentage of total estimated project costs at completion. \nThe estimation of total project costs involves significant \njudgement and is assessed throughout the period of the \ncontract to reflect any changes based on the latest available \ninformation. In addition, provisions for estimated losses, if \nany, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period \nin which such losses become probable based on the total \nestimated project costs.\nWe identified the revenue recognition for fixed-price \ncontracts where the percentage-of-completion method \nis used as a key audit matter because of the significant \njudgement involved in estimating the efforts to complete \nsuch contracts.\nThis estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires \nconsideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred \nto-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the \nremaining performance obligations.  \nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in \nevaluating the audit evidence supporting estimated efforts \nto complete and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate \nthe reasonableness of the total estimated efforts used to \nrecognise revenue from fixed-price contracts.\nStandalone Financial Statement under Ind

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, \nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \nwith SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it \nexists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they \ncould reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these Standalone \nFinancial Statements. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \nthroughout the audit. We also:\n\u2022\tIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement \nof the Standalone Financial Statements, whether due \nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that \nis sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our \nopinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement \nresulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from \nerror, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional \nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of \ninternal control.\n\u2022\tObtain an understanding of internal financial control \nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances.

If we conclude that a material \nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention \nin our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the \nStandalone Financial Statements or, if such disclosures \nare inadequate, to modify our opinion.

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF STANDALONE \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n (i)  Statement of compliance and basis of \npreparation \n    The standalone financial statements have been \nprepared in compliance with Indian Accounting \nStandards ( \u201cInd AS\u201d ), the provisions of the \nCompanies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Companies Act\u201d) , as \napplicable and guidelines issued by the Securities \nand Exchange Board of India ( \u201cSEBI\u201d ). The Ind \nAS are prescribed under Section 133 of the \nCompanies Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies \n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and \namendments issued thereafter.\n  Accounting policies have been applied consistently \nto all periods presented in these standalone \nfinancial statements, except for the adoption of \nnew accounting standards, amendments and \ninterpretations effective from April 1, 2022.\n  The standalone financial statements correspond to \nthe classification provisions contained in Ind AS 1, \n\u201cPresentation of Financial Statements\u201d. For clarity, \nvarious items are aggregated in the statement of \nprofit and loss and balance sheet. These items \nare disaggregated separately in the notes to the \nstandalone financial statements, where applicable. \n  All amounts included in the standalone financial \nstatements are reported in millions of Indian \nrupees ( H in millions) except share and per share \ndata, unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding off, \nthe numbers presented throughout the document may not add up precisely to the totals and \npercentages may not precisely reflect the absolute \nfigures. Previous year figures have been regrouped/\nrearranged, wherever necessary.\n (ii) Basis of measurement \n   The standalone financial statements have been \nprepared on a historical cost convention and on \nan accrual basis, except for the following material \nitems, which have been measured at fair value as \nrequired by relevant Ind AS:\n a) Derivative financial instruments;\n b) Financial instruments classified as fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income or fair \nvalue through profit or loss;\n c) The defined benefit liability/(asset) is \nrecognised as the present value of defined \nbenefit obligation less fair value of plan \nassets; and\n d) Contingent consideration.\n (iii) Use of estimates and judgment \n    The preparation of these standalone financial \nstatements in conformity with Ind AS requires \nthe management to make judgments, accounting \nestimates and assumptions that affect the \napplication of accounting policies and the \nreported amounts of assets, liabilities, income \nand expenses. Accounting estimates are monetary \namounts in the standalone financial statements \nthat are subject to measurement uncertainty. An \naccounting policy may require items in standalone \nfinancial statements to be measured at monetary \namounts that cannot be observed directly and must \ninstead be estimated. In such a case, management \ndevelops an accounting estimate to achieve \nthe objective set out by the accounting policy. \nDeveloping accounting estimates involves the use \nof judgments or assumptions based on the latest \navailable and reliable information. Actual results \nmay differ from those accounting estimates.\n   Accounting estimates and underlying assumptions \nare reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to \naccounting estimates are recognised in the period \nin which the estimates are changed and in any \nfuture periods affected. In particular, information \nabout material areas of estimation, uncertainty and \ncritical judgments in applying accounting policies \n(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS\n167\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Value Creation for Stakeholders Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4542, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "84bfcb7c-2f0c-40c2-ae11-e2440721d2f3": {"__data__": {"id_": "84bfcb7c-2f0c-40c2-ae11-e2440721d2f3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5013fec-978e-4594-8ced-6fda38e403ca", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "159", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "01bc9d3b085ac82b37cef96ad3a8debe02c987fe9d4c9deec0d203fdca651a6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9ca66448-dea1-4fa3-a6fc-dd2164879dda", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "158", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "56cce7ab9ad0c9766fe5c4e7f68978398b1f530f5c12c9bbe42093794c7efb17", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "95ea316f-17a2-49c2-baf9-efa78dcb7fa7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c68b7e5e8ccf2c3a8883a1f7b6f8e89a31f159b25936e989b8f15582368ddbe7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "that have the material effect on the amounts \nrecognised in the standalone financial statements \nare included in the following notes:\n  a)  Revenue recognition: The Company applies \njudgement to determine whether each product \nor service promised to a customer is capable \nof being distinct, and is distinct in the context \nof the contract, if not, the promised product \nor service is combined and accounted as a \nsingle performance obligation. The Company \nallocates the Transaction Price (as defined \nbelow) to separately identifiable performance \nobligation deliverables based on their relative \nstand-alone selling price. In cases where the \nCompany is unable to determine the stand-\nalone selling price the Company uses expected \ncost-plus margin approach in estimating \nthe stand-alone selling price. The Company \nuses the percentage of completion method \nusing the input (cost expended) method to \nmeasure progress towards completion in \nrespect of fixed-price contracts. Percentage \nof completion method accounting relies on \nestimates of total expected contract revenue \nand costs. This method is followed when \nreasonably dependable estimates of the \nrevenues and costs applicable to various \nelements of the contract can be made. Key \nfactors that are reviewed in estimating the \nfuture costs to complete include estimates \nof future labor costs and productivity \nefficiencies. Because the financial reporting of \nthese contracts depends on estimates that are \nassessed continually during the term of these \ncontracts, revenue recognised, profit and \ntiming of revenue for remaining performance \nobligations are subject to revisions as the \ncontract progresses to completion. When \nestimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, \nthe loss is provided for in the period in which \nthe loss becomes probable. Volume discounts \nare recorded as a reduction of revenue. When \nthe amount of discount varies with the levels of \nrevenue, volume discount is recorded based on \nestimate of future revenue from the customer.\n  b)  Impairment testing:  Goodwill recognised \non business combination is tested for \nimpairment at least annually and when events occur or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat the recoverable amount of goodwill or \na cash generating unit to which goodwill \npertains, is less than the carrying value. \nThe Company assesses acquired intangible \nassets with finite useful life for impairment \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that the carrying amount may not \nbe recoverable. The recoverable amount of \nan asset or a cash generating unit is higher \nof value in use and fair value less cost of \ndisposal. The calculation of value in use of an \nasset or a cash generating unit involves use of \nsignificant estimates and assumptions which \ninclude turnover, growth rates and net margins \nused to calculate projected future cash flows, \nrisk-adjusted discount rate, future economic \nand market conditions. \n  c)  Impairment of investment in subsidiaries:  \nThe Company reviews its carrying value of \ninvestments carried at cost (net of impairment, \nif any) annually or more frequently when there \nis indication for impairment. If the recoverable \namount is less than its carrying amount, \nthe impairment loss is accounted for in the \nstatement of profit and loss. \n  d)  Income taxes:  The major tax jurisdictions for \nthe Company are India and the United States \nof America.\n    Significant judgments are involved in \ndetermining the provision for income taxes \nincluding judgment on whether tax positions \nare probable of being sustained in tax \nassessments. A tax assessment can involve \ncomplex issues, which can only be resolved \nover extended time periods. \n     Deferred tax is recorded on temporary \ndifferences between the tax bases of assets \nand liabilities and their carrying amounts, \nat the rates that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted at the reporting date. \nThe ultimate realisation of deferred tax \nassets is dependent upon the generation of \nfuture taxable profits during the periods in \nwhich those temporary differences and tax \nloss carry-forwards become deductible.

Additionally, estimating \nthe acquisition date fair value of the \nidentifiable assets acquired (including useful \nlife estimates), liabilities assumed, and  \ncontingent consideration assumed involves \nmanagement judgment. These measurements \nare based on information available at the \nacquisition date and are based on expectations \nand assumptions that have been deemed \nreasonable by management. Changes in these \njudgments, estimates, and assumptions can \nmaterially affect the results of operations. \n  f)\t\tDefined\tbenefit\tplans\tand\tcompensated \t\nabsences: The cost of the defined benefit \nplans, compensated absences and the \npresent value of the defined benefit \nobligations are based on actuarial valuation \nusing the projected unit credit method. An \nactuarial valuation involves making various \nassumptions that may differ from actual \ndevelopments in the future. These include \nthe determination of the discount rate, future \nsalary increases and mortality rates. Due \nto the complexities involved in the valuation \nand its long-term nature, a defined benefit \nobligation is highly sensitive to changes in \nthese assumptions. All assumptions are \nreviewed at each reporting date. \n  g)\t\tExpected\t credit\tlosses\ton\tfinancial\t assets:  \nThe impairment provisions of financial assets \nare based on assumptions about risk of \ndefault and expected timing of collection. \nThe Company uses judgment in making these \nassumptions and selecting the inputs to the \nexpected credit loss calculation based on the \nCompany\u2019s history of collections, customer\u2019s \ncreditworthiness, existing market conditions \nas well as forward looking estimates at the \nend of each reporting period.   h)  Useful lives of property, plant and \nequipment:  The Company depreciates \nproperty, plant and equipment on a straight-\nline basis over estimated useful lives of the \nassets. The charge in respect of periodic \ndepreciation is derived based on an estimate \nof an asset\u2019s expected useful life and the \nexpected residual value at the end of its life. \nThe lives are based on historical experience \nwith similar assets as well as anticipation of \nfuture events, which may impact their life, \nsuch as changes in technology. The estimated \nuseful life is reviewed at least annually.  \n  i)  Useful lives of intangible assets:  The \nCompany amortises intangible assets on a \nstraight-line basis over estimated useful lives \nof the assets. The useful life is estimated based \non a number of factors including the effects of \nobsolescence, demand, competition and other \neconomic factors such as the stability of the \nindustry and known technological advances \nand the level of maintenance expenditures \nrequired to obtain the expected future cash \nflows from the assets. The estimated useful \nlife is reviewed at least annually.\n  j)  Provisions and contingent liabilities: The \nCompany estimates the provisions that have \npresent obligations as a result of past events, \nand it is probable that outflow of resources \nwill be required to settle the obligations. These \nprovisions are reviewed at the end of each \nreporting date and are adjusted to reflect the \ncurrent best estimates.\n    The Company uses significant judgement to \ndisclose contingent liabilities. Contingent \nliabilities are disclosed when there is a \npossible obligation arising from past events, \nthe existence of which will be confirmed \nonly by the occurrence or non-occurrence \nof one or more uncertain future events not \nwholly within the control of the Company or \na present obligation that arises from past \nevents where it is either not probable that an \noutflow of resources will be required to settle \nthe obligation or a reliable estimate of the \namount cannot be made.

For \nthese short-term and low value leases, the \nCompany recognises the lease payments as an \noperating expense on a straight-line basis over \nthe lease term.\n  The cost of the RoU assets comprises the \namount of the initial measurement of the lease \nliability, any lease payments made at or before \nthe inception date of the lease, plus any initial \ndirect costs, less any lease incentives received. \nSubsequently, the RoU assets are measured \nat cost less any accumulated depreciation and \naccumulated impairment losses, if any. The \nRoU assets are depreciated using the straight-\nline method from the commencement date over \nthe shorter of lease term or useful life of RoU \nassets. The estimated useful lives of RoU assets \nare determined on the same basis as those of \nproperty, plant and equipment.\n  The Company applies Ind AS 36 to determine \nwhether a RoU asset is impaired and accounts for \nany identified impairment loss as described in the \nimpairment of non-financial assets below. \n  For lease liabilities at the commencement of the \nlease, the Company measures the lease liability \nat the present value of the lease payments that \nare not paid at that date. The lease payments are \ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the \nlease, if that rate is readily determined, if that rate \nis not readily determined, the lease payments are \ndiscounted using the incremental borrowing rate \nthat the Company would have to pay to borrow \nfunds, including the consideration of factors such \nas the nature of the asset and location, collateral, \nmarket terms and conditions, as applicable in a \nsimilar economic environment.\n  After the commencement date, the amount \nof lease liabilities is increased to reflect the \naccretion of interest and reduced for the lease \npayments made.\n  The Company recognises the amount of the re-\nmeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment \nto the RoU assets. Where the carrying amount of \nthe RoU asset is reduced to zero and there is a \nfurther reduction in the measurement of the lease \nliability, the Company recognises any remaining \namount of the re-measurement in the statement \nof profit and loss.  Payment of lease liabilities are classified as cash \nused in financing activities in the statement of \ncash flows.\n  The Company as a lessor\n  Leases under which the Company is a lessor \nare classified as a finance or operating lease. \nLease contracts where all the risks and rewards \nare substantially transferred to the lessee are \nclassified as a finance lease. All other leases are \nclassified as operating lease.\n  For leases under which the Company is an \nintermediate lessor, the Company accounts for \nthe head-lease and the sub-lease as two separate \ncontracts. The sub-lease is further classified \neither as a finance lease or an operating lease by \nreference to the RoU asset arising from the head-\nlease. \n (viii)  Inventories \n  Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net \nrealisable value, including necessary provision \nfor obsolescence.

Revenue towards satisfaction of the \nperformance obligation is measured at the \namount of the Transaction Price (net of variable \nconsideration on account of discounts and \nallowances) allocated to that performance \nobligation. To recognise revenues, the Company \napplies the following five step approach:  \n(1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify \nthe performance obligations in the contract,  \n(3) determine the Transaction Price, (4) allocate the \nTransaction Price to the performance obligations \nin the contract, and (5) recognise revenues when \na performance obligation is satisfied. When \nthere is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue \nrecognition is postponed until such uncertainty \nis resolved.\n   At contract inception, the Company assesses \nits promise to transfer products or services to \na customer to identify separate performance \nobligations. The Company applies judgement \nto determine whether each product or service \npromised to a customer is capable of being \ndistinct, and are distinct in the context of the \ncontract, if not, the promised products or \nservices are combined and accounted as a single \nperformance obligation. The Company allocates \nthe Transaction Price to separately identifiable \nperformance obligations based on their relative \nstand-alone selling price or residual method. \nStand-alone selling prices are determined \nbased on sale prices for the components when \nit is regularly sold separately, in cases where \nthe Company is unable to determine the stand-\nalone selling price, the Company uses third-party \nprices for similar deliverables or the Company \nuses expected cost-plus margin approach in \nestimating the stand-alone selling price.  For performance obligations where control is \ntransferred over time, revenues are recognised \nby measuring progress towards completion of \nthe performance obligation. The selection of the \nmethod to measure progress towards completion \nrequires judgment and is based on the nature of \nthe promised products or services to be provided.\n  The method for recognising revenues and costs \ndepends on the nature of the services rendered:\n  A.  Time and materials contracts \n     Revenues and costs relating to time and \nmaterials contracts are recognised as the \nrelated services are rendered. \n  B. Fixed-price contracts \n    i) Fixed-price development contracts\n      Revenues from fixed-price development \ncontracts, including software develop-\nment, and integration contracts, where \nthe performance obligations are satisfied \nover time, are recognised using the \n\u201cpercentage-of-completion\u201d method. The \nperformance obligations are satisfied \nas and when the services are rendered \nsince the customer generally obtains \ncontrol of the work as it progresses. \nPercentage of completion is determined \nbased on project costs incurred to date \nas a percentage of total estimated \nproject costs required to complete the \nproject. The cost expended (or input) \nmethod has been used to measure \nprogress towards completion as there is \na direct relationship between input and \nproductivity. If the Company is not able \nto reasonably measure the progress of \ncompletion, revenue is recognised only \nto the extent of costs incurred for which \nrecoverability is probable.

Income tax expense is recognised in the \nstatement of profit and loss except to the \nextent it relates to a business combination, or \nitems directly recognised in equity or in other \ncomprehensive income.\n  a) Current income tax \n    Current income tax for the current and \nprior periods are measured at the amount  \nexpected to be recovered from or paid to the \ntaxation authorities based on the taxable \nincome for the period. The tax rates and \ntax laws used to compute the current tax  \namounts are those that are enacted or \nsubstantively enacted as at the reporting \ndate and applicable for the period. While \ndetermining the tax provisions, the Company \nassesses whether each uncertain tax \nposition is to be considered separately \nor together with one or more uncertain \ntax positions depending upon the nature \nand circumstances of each uncertain tax \nposition. The Company offsets current tax \nassets and current tax liabilities, where it \nhas a legally enforceable right to set off the \nrecognised amounts and where it intends \neither to settle on a net basis, or to realise \nthe asset and liability simultaneously.\n  b) Deferred income tax \n    Deferred income tax is recognised using the \nbalance sheet approach. Deferred income \ntax assets and liabilities are recognised for \ndeductible and taxable temporary differences \narising between the tax base of assets \nand liabilities and their carrying amount \nin these standalone financial statements, \nexcept when the deferred income tax arises \nfrom the initial recognition of goodwill or an \nasset or liability in a transaction that is not \na business combination and affects neither \naccounting nor taxable profits or loss at the \ntime of the transaction. \n    Deferred income tax assets are recognised \nto the extent it is probable that taxable profit \nwill be available against whi ch the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward \nof unused tax credits and unused tax losses \ncan be utilised. \n  Deferred income tax liabilities are \nrecognised for all taxable temporary \ndifferences except in respect of taxable \ntemporary differences that is expected \nto reverse within the tax holiday period, \ntaxable temporary differences associated \nwith investments in subsidiaries, associates \nand foreign branches where the timing of \nthe reversal of the temporary difference \ncan be controlled and it is probable that the \ntemporary difference will not reverse in the \nforeseeable future. \n  The carrying amount of deferred income tax \nassets is reviewed at each reporting date \nand reduced to the extent that it is no longer \nprobable that sufficient taxable profit will be \navailable to allow all or part of the deferred \nincome tax asset to be utilised. \n  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities \nare measured at the tax rates that are \nexpected to apply in the period when the \nasset is realised or the liability is settled, \nbased on tax rates (and tax laws) that have \nbeen enacted or substantively enacted at the \nreporting date. \n  The Company offsets deferred income \ntax assets and liabilities, where it has a \nlegally enforceable right to offset current \ntax assets against current tax liabilities, \nand they relate to taxes levied by the same \ntaxation authority on either the same taxable \nentity, or on different taxable entities where \nthere is a right and an intention to settle the \ncurrent tax liabilities and assets on a net \nbasis or their tax assets and liabilities will be \nrealised simultaneously.\n (xvii) Earnings per share \n  Basic earnings per share is computed using \nthe weighted average number of equity shares \noutstanding during the period adjusted for \ntreasury shares held. Diluted earnings per \nshare is computed using the weighted-average \nnumber of equity and dilutive equivalent \nshares outstanding during the period, using the \n(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS\n183\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Value Creation for Stakeholders Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4183, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a62137d9-cb36-4935-a014-061462ca7a8f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a62137d9-cb36-4935-a014-061462ca7a8f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "306b6d1e-4f66-4716-9b0a-71b34eb8f3dc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "175", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "2660da38390bff4408fe9d4a827b4de03e2c072dfa8e5465e117ab8018ee1c47", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6a64b6f4-e915-4774-b358-fe346c348a45", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "174", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c3bea83a14ccc5674e7ad8c4132482394c917a8cb1a7c33d25fba6110fabec02", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0832a2b5-59d2-4091-9d70-54b97d64dc7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "43612b042113d9104467f46eb5694e4a91cffad8134dc6d50523732d6c1b9288", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "treasury stock method for options, except where \nthe results would be anti-dilutive.\n  The number of equity shares and potentially \ndilutive equity shares are adjusted \nretrospectively for all periods presented for \nany splits and bonus shares issues including \nfor change effected prior to the approval of the \nstandalone financial statements by the Board \nof Directors.\n (xviii)\tStatement\tof\tcash\tflows\n  Cash flows are reported using the indirect \nmethod, whereby profit for the period is adjusted \nfor the effects of transactions of a non-cash \nnature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future \noperating cash receipts or payments and item of \nincome or expenses associated with investing \nor financing cash flows.

A sensitivity analysis to the change in the key parameters (turnover and earnings \nmultiples), did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU\u2019s recoverable amount would fall below its carrying amount.\n The movement in other intangible assets is given below:\nOther intangible assets\nCustomer related Marketing related Total\nGross carrying value:\nAs at April 1, 2022 \u00a0H 4,470\u00a0 \u00a0H 32\u00a0 \u00a0H 4,502\u00a0\nDeductions/adjustments (2,175) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2,175)\nAs at March 31, 2023 \u00a0H 2,295\u00a0 \u00a0H 32\u00a0 \u00a0H 2,327\u00a0\nAccumulated amortisation/impairment:\nAs at April 1, 2022 \u00a0H 2,584\u00a0 \u00a0H 11\u00a0 \u00a0H 2,595\u00a0\nAmortisation 597\u00a0 5\u00a0 602\u00a0\nDeductions/adjustments (2,175) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (2,175)\nAs at March 31, 2023 \u00a0H 1,006\u00a0 \u00a0H 16\u00a0 \u00a0H 1,022\u00a0\nNet carrying value as at March 31, 2023 \u00a0H 1,289\u00a0 \u00a0H 16\u00a0 \u00a0H 1,305\u00a0\n(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS\nAmb itions  Realized .\n188\nReporting Context Our Capabilities Governance and Leadership Performance Overview", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3290, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dcd4387f-9e00-42fa-a93e-d7fd0c344aab": {"__data__": {"id_": "dcd4387f-9e00-42fa-a93e-d7fd0c344aab", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2d214f1d-f327-4524-a463-e8227851a130", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "180", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "44a49334f526ae78c145d0e3cb49994541535eee65896c06dc2350b18ba6eda7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5372bb5f-d03f-4a07-aabe-09d0665d11ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "179", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c1a87b794c2ea52169be187415b97faccc76a5c429989b9d072fb3d9bc7b8261", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d0902e85-dd05-4800-8efb-18a3ba80e86a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "54fbc96f3293e3da4ea3dce9a57116b089d8bf88ba22876e9eb4860ddd9b2c4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Other intangible assets\nCustomer related Marketing related Total\nGross carrying value:\nAs at April 1, 2021 \u00a0H 4,999\u00a0 \u00a0H 32\u00a0 \u00a0H 5,031\u00a0\nDeductions/adjustments (529) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (529)\nAs at March 31, 2022 \u00a0H 4,470\u00a0 \u00a0H 32\u00a0 \u00a0H 4,502\u00a0\nAccumulated amortisation/ impairment:\nAs at April 1, 2021 \u00a0H 2,502\u00a0 \u00a0H 6\u00a0 \u00a0H 2,508\u00a0\nAmortisation 611\u00a0 5\u00a0 616\u00a0\nDeductions/adjustments (529) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (529)\nAs at March 31, 2022 \u00a0H 2,584\u00a0 \u00a0H 11\u00a0 \u00a0H 2,595\u00a0\nNet carrying value as at March 31, 2022 \u00a0H 1,886\u00a0 \u00a0H 21\u00a0 \u00a0H 1,907\u00a0\n  As at March 31, 2023, the net carrying value and estimated remaining amortisation period for intangible assets acquired \non acquisition are as follows:\nAcquisition Net carrying value Estimated remaining amortisation period\nVara Infotech Private Limited H 1,305 3.5 - 6.5 years\nTotal H 1,305\n8.

2023 are expected to occur and \nbe reclassified to the statement of profit and loss over a period of two years.\n   As at March 31, 2023 and 2022, there were no significant gains or losses on derivative transactions or portions thereof \nthat have become ineffective as hedges or associated with an underlying exposure that did not occur.\n  Sale\u202fof\u202ffinancial\u202fassets\u202f\n   From time to time, in the normal course of business, the Company transfers accounts receivables, unbilled receivables, \nnet investment in finance lease receivables (financial assets) to banks. Under the terms of the arrangements, the \nCompany either substantially transfers its risks and rewards or surrenders control over the financial assets and transfer \nis without recourse. Accordingly, on such transfers the financial assets are derecognised and considered as sale of \nfinancial assets. Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the time of sale based on \nthe carrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact of such transactions \non our cash flow and liquidity for the years ended March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 is not material. \n  Financial risk management \n  Market Risk \n   Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in \nthe price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest \nrates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market \nrisk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, \npayables and loans and borrowings. \n   The Company\u2019s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating \nactivities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company\u2019s \nearnings and equity to losses. \n  Risk Management Procedures \n   The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent \ncontrol over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk \nmanagement objectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities \nof this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency \nexposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.\n  Foreign currency risk \n   The Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. \nConsequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the \nUnited States of America and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. \nThe exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash \nflows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is in the U.S. \nDollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in \nIndian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years \nand may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s results of operations.\n   The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters foreign currency derivative \ninstruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including the use \nof derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign \ncurrency. \n   The Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange \nexposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows. \n   As at March 31, 2023, a \u00a0H 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the US dollar would result in approximately  \nH 3,360 (statement of profit and loss H 1,502 and other comprehensive income H 1,858) decrease in the fair value, and a  \nH 1 decrease would result in approximately H 3,341\u00a0(statement of profit and loss H 1,503 and other comprehensive income \n(C in millions,

Issuer risk is minimised by only buying securities which are at \nleast AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering \ninto transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. \nExposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on \ncredit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis \nincluding financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews. \n  Liquidity risk \n  Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a \nreasonable price. The Company\u2019s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as \nsettlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. \nManagement monitors the Company\u2019s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts based on the expected cash flows. \nAs at March 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.\n  The table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities at the \nreporting date.

benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within \nequity. Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the statement of profit \nand loss.\n  In assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the \ndeferred tax asset will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation \nof future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become \ndeductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income \nand tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that \nthe Company will realise the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered \nrealisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward \nperiod are reduced. \n  The Company has recognised deferred tax assets of H 1,011 and H 1,169 as at March 31, 2023 and 2022 primarily in respect \nof capital loss incurred on account of liquidation of an investment. Management\u2019s projections of future taxable capital \ngain support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilise this deferred tax \nasset.\n  We have calculated our domestic tax liability under normal provisions. Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been \nrecognised towards MAT in the balance sheet for the years ended March\u00a031, 2023 and 2022. The effective MAT rate is \n17 .47%. The excess tax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward for a period \nof fifteen years and set-off against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions.\n  A substantial portion of the profits of the Company\u2019s India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits \nattributable to export operations and profits from units established under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme. \nUnits in designated special economic zones providing service on or after April\u00a01, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction of \n100 percent of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of provision \nof services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years. 50% tax deduction is available for a further \nfive years subject to the unit meeting certain defined conditions. Profits from certain other undertakings are also eligible \nfor preferential tax treatment.

Further, it \nis not practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.\n22. REVENUE FROM OPERATIONS\n A. Contract Assets and Liabilities\n   Contract assets:  During the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, H 10,306 and H 9,978 of contract assets pertaining \nto fixed-price development contracts have been reclassified to receivables on completion of milestones.\n   Contract liabilities:  During the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognised revenue of H 16,470 \nand H 15,150 arising from contract liabilities as at March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n   Contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each \nreporting period.\n B. Remaining Performance Obligations\n   Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been \nrecognised, which includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognised as revenue in future \nperiods. Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers \nin an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to \ndate, which are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based.\n   As at March 31, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate amount of the Transaction Price allocated to remaining performance \nobligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were H 177 ,270 and H 171,136, respectively of \nwhich approximately 77% and 70%, respectively is expected to be recognised as revenues within two years, and the \nremainder thereafter. This includes contracts, with a substantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is \nterminated without cause by the customer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time \nof inception. Historically, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.\n C. Disaggregation of Revenue\n   The tables below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment and nature \nof contract. The Company believes that the below disaggregation best depicts the nature, amount, timing and \nuncertainty of revenue and cash flows from economic factors.\nRevenue by business segment\nYear ended  \nMarch 31, 2023Year ended  \nMarch 31, 2022\nRendering of services \u00a0H 674,084\u00a0 \u00a0H 590,956\u00a0\nSale of products 3,450\u00a0 4,788\u00a0\n\u00a0H\u202f677,534\u00a0 \u00a0H 595,744\u00a0\nRevenue by nature of contract\nYear ended  \nMarch 31, 2023Year ended  \nMarch 31, 2022\nFixed-price and volume based \u00a0H 399,071\u00a0 \u00a0H 359,322\u00a0\nTime and Materials 275,013\u00a0 231,634\u00a0\nProducts 3,450\u00a0 4,788\u00a0\n\u00a0H\u202f677,534\u00a0 \u00a0H 595,744 \u00a0\n(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS\nAmb itions  Realized .\n212\nReporting Context Our Capabilities Governance and Leadership Performance Overview", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 3469, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e122f7c1-9711-4cf2-9d67-21b78bce57c8": {"__data__": {"id_": "e122f7c1-9711-4cf2-9d67-21b78bce57c8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d55daf5c-4f35-43ce-bbbf-45fc746d7017", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "204", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "55556c70e0f28986509b82a8fbfce21a8c55e479b5c49db30e7c2f68f04be6c0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab58cee8-6fbb-4d4d-8018-6fe5ed878cf0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "203", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "2b4643347dbde34a6d384156aef4dde938f0277857ac0ba78aec348a962e2d74", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "03d20e17-64d0-46cd-b199-dc19c743d4ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4bbabb9aafa8027e6e764bd98f0efbdc9a2ae897f0d38483ce4ae5447ba41fb2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "23.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCapital commitments:  As at March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022 the Company had committed to spend approximately  \nH 7 ,208 and H 10,502, respectively, under agreements to purchase/construct property and equipment. These amounts are \nnet of capital advances paid in respect of these purchases.\nContingent liabilities to the extent not provided for:\nAs at\nMarch 31, 2023As at \nMarch 31, 2022\nGuarantees given by the banks on behalf of the Company  H 11,782  H 12,536 \nGuarantees given by the Company on behalf of subsidiaries 6 4,711 59,677 \n Contingencies and lawsuits: \n  The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims resulting from tax assessment orders/penalty notices issued \nunder the Income Tax Act, 1961, which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business. Some of the claims involve \ncomplex issues and it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result \nfrom ultimate resolution of such proceedings. However, the resolution of these legal proceedings is not likely to have a \nmaterial and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n  The Company\u2019s assessments are completed for the years up to March 31, 2019. The Company has received demands \non multiple tax issues. These claims are primarily arising out of denial of deduction under section 10A of the Income \nTax Act, 1961 in respect of profit earned by the Company\u2019s undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bengaluru, the \nappeals filed against the said demand before the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by the \nsecond appellate authority for the years up to March 31, 2008 which either has been or may be contested by the Income \ntax authorities before the Supreme Court of India. Other claims relate to disallowance of tax benefits on profits earned \nfrom Software Technology Park and Special Economic Zone units, capitalisation of research and development expenses, \ntransfer pricing adjustments on intercompany / inter unit transactions and other issues.\n  Income tax claims against the Company amounting to H 91,374 and H 92,388 are not acknowledged as debt as at March \n31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. These matters are pending before various Appellate Authorities and the \nmanagement expects its position will likely be upheld on ultimate resolution and will not have a material adverse effect \non the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\n  The contingent liability in respect of disputed demands for excise duty, custom duty, sales tax and other matters \namounting to H 15,240 and H 12,092 as of March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2022, respectively. However, the resolution of \nthese disputed demands is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial \nposition of the Company.\n  The Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India, through a ruling in February 2019, provided interpretation on the components \nof Salary on which the Company and its employees are to contribute towards Provident Fund under the Employee\u2019s \nProvident Fund Act.

In addition, provisions for estimated losses, if \nany, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period \nin which such losses become probable based on the total \nestimated project costs\nWe identified the revenue recognition for fixed-price contracts \nwhere the percentage-of-completion method is used as a key \naudit matter because of the significant judgement involved in \nestimating the efforts to complete such contracts. \nThis estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires \nconsideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred \nto-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the \nremaining performance obligations.\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in \nevaluating the audit evidence supporting estimated efforts \nto complete and a

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, \nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \nwith SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it \nexists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they \ncould reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these Consolidated \nFinancial Statements. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \nthroughout the audit. We also:\n\u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement \nof the Consolidated Financial Statements, whether due \nto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures \nresponsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. \nThe risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting \nfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as \nfraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal financial control \nrelevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \nthat are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section \n143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing \nour opinion on whether the Company and its subsidiary \ncompanies which are companies incorporated in India, \nhas adequate internal financial controls with reference \nto Consolidated Financial Statements in place and the \noperating effectiveness of such controls.\n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used \nand the reasonableness of accounting estimates and \nrelated disclosures made by the management.\n\u2022 Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use \nof the going concern basis of accounting and, based \non the audit evidence obtained, whether a material \nuncertainty exists related to events or conditions that \nmay cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group to \ncontinue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material \nuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention \nin our auditor\u2019s report to the related disclosures in the Consolidated Financial Statements or, if such disclosures \nare inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are \nbased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may \ncause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\u2022 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content \nof the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the \ndisclosures, and whether the Consolidated Financial \nStatements represent the underlying transactions and \nevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\u2022 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the \nfinancial information of the entities and business activities \nwithin the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements. \nMateriality is the magnitude of misstatements in the \nConsolidated Financial Statements that, individually or in \naggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a \nreasonably knowledgeable user of the Consolidated Financial \nStatements may be influenced.

BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED \nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n (i)  Statement of compliance and basis of \npreparation\n    The consolidated financial statements have been \nprepared in compliance with Indian Accounting \nStandards (\u201c Ind AS \u201d), the provisions of the \nCompanies Act, 2013 (\u201c the Companies Act \u201d), as \napplicable and guidelines issued by the Securities \nand Exchange Board of India (\u201c SEBI \u201d). The Ind \nAS are prescribed under Section 133 of the \nCompanies Act read with Rule 3 of the Companies \n(Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and \namendments issued thereafter.\n   The consolidated financial statements correspond \nto the classification provisions contained in Ind \nAS 1, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements\u201d. \nFor clarity, various items are aggregated in \nthe consolidated statement of profit and loss \nand consolidated balance sheet. These items \nare disaggregated separately in the notes to \nthe consolidated financial statements, where \napplicable. The accounting policies have been \nconsistently applied to all periods presented in \nthese financial statements, except for the adoption \nof new accounting standards, amendments and \ninterpretations effective from April 1, 2022.\n   All amounts included in the consolidated financial statements are reported in millions of Indian \nrupees ( H in millions) except share and per share \ndata, unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding off, \nthe numbers presented throughout the document \nmay not add up precisely to the totals and \npercentages may not precisely reflect the absolute \nfigures. Previous year figures have been regrouped/\nrearranged, wherever necessary.\n (ii)  Basis of measurement \n   The consolidated financial statements have been \nprepared on a historical cost convention and on \nan accrual basis, except for the following material \nitems which have been measured at fair value as \nrequired by relevant Ind AS:\na.   Derivative  financial instruments; \nb.  Financial instruments classified as fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income or fair \nvalue through profit or loss;\nc.  The defined benefit liability/(asset) is recognised \nas the present value of defined benefit obligation \nless fair value of plan assets; and \nd. Contingent consideration.\n  (iii)    Use of estimates and judgment \n     The preparation of the consolidated financial \nstatements in conformity with Ind AS requires \nthe management to make judgments, accounting \nestimates and assumptions that affect the \napplication of accounting policies and the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. \nAccounting estimates are monetary amounts in the \nconsolidated financial statements that are subject \nto measurement uncertainty. An accounting \npolicy may require items in consolidated financial \nstatements to be measured at monetary amounts \nthat cannot be observed directly and must instead \nbe estimated. In such a case, management \ndevelops an accounting estimate to achieve \nthe objective set out by the accounting policy. \nDeveloping accounting estimates involves the use \nof judgments or assumptions based on the latest \navailable and reliable information. Actual results \nmay differ from those accounting estimates.\n    Accounting estimates and underlying assumptions \nare reviewed on an ongoing basis.

In particular, information \nabout material areas of estimation, uncertainty and \ncritical judgments in applying accounting policies \nthat have the material effect on the amounts \nrecognised in the consolidated financial statements \nare included in the following notes:\n  a)  Revenue recognition:  The Company applies \njudgement to determine whether each product \nor service promised to a customer is capable \nof being distinct, and is distinct in the context \nof the contract, if not, the promised product \nor service is combined and accounted as a \nsingle performance obligation. The Company \nallocates the Transaction Price (as defined \nbelow) to separately identifiable performance \nobligation deliverables based on their relative \nstand-alone selling price. In cases where the \nCompany is unable to determine the stand-\nalone selling price the Company uses expected \ncost-plus margin approach in estimating \nthe stand-alone selling price. The Company \nuses the percentage of completion method \nusing the input (cost expended) method to \nmeasure progress towards completion in \nrespect of fixed-price contracts. Percentage \nof completion method accounting relies on \nestimates of total expected contract revenue \nand costs. This method is followed when \nreasonably dependable estimates of the \nrevenues and costs applicable to various \nelements of the contract can be made. Key \nfactors that are reviewed in estimating the \nfuture costs to complete include estimates \nof future labor costs and productivity \nefficiencies. Because the financial reporting \nof these contracts depends on estimates that \nare assessed continually during the term of \nthese contracts, revenue recognised, profit and \ntiming of revenue for remaining performance \nobligations are subject to revisions as the \ncontract progresses to completion. When \nestimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, \nthe loss is provided for in the period in which \nthe loss becomes probable. Volume discounts \nare recorded as a reduction of revenue. When \nthe amount of discount varies with the levels of \nrevenue, volume discount is recorded based on \nestimate of future revenue from the customer.    b)  Impairment testing:  Goodwill recognised on \nbusiness combination is tested for impairment \nat least annually and when events occur or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the \nrecoverable amount of goodwill or a cash \ngenerating unit to which goodwill pertains, \nis less than the carrying value. The Company \nassesses acquired intangible assets with finite \nuseful life for impairment whenever events \nor changes in circumstances indicate that \nthe carrying amount may not be recoverable. \nThe recoverable amount of an asset or a \ncash generating unit is higher of value-in-\nuse and fair value less cost of disposal. The \ncalculation of value-in-use of an asset or a \ncash generating unit involves use of significant \nestimates and assumptions which include \nturnover, growth rates and net margins used \nto calculate projected future cash flows, risk-\nadjusted discount rate, future economic and \nmarket conditions.\n  c)  Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for \nthe Company are India and the United States \nof America. \n     Significant judgments are involved in \ndetermining the provision for income taxes \nincluding judgment on whether tax positions \nare probable of being sustained in tax \nassessments. A tax assessment can involve \ncomplex issues, which can only be resolved \nover extended time periods. \n      Deferred tax is recorded on temporary \ndifferences between the tax bases of assets \nand liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the \nrates that have been enacted or substantively \nenacted at the reporting date. The ultimate \nrealisation of deferred tax assets is dependent \nupon the generation of future taxable profits \nduring the periods in which those temporary \ndifferences and tax loss carry-forwards \nbecome deductible. The Company considers \nexpected reversal of deferred tax liabilities \nand projected future taxable income in making \nthis assessment. The amount of deferred tax \nassets considered realisable, however, could \nreduce in the near term if estimates of future \ntaxable income during the carry-forward \nperiod are reduced.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4585, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "212b0975-be84-42b3-918b-080d2be61173": {"__data__": {"id_": "212b0975-be84-42b3-918b-080d2be61173", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "242", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c94bf67f-6044-41dd-be2c-77d527f24faf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "242", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "eb078e5ae925d7708e35d2a84e533f93cac44926a807848513cd92ffa5887fb0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7336e95a-9b08-4fc4-a375-836ef0e0d2a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "241", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "bb5ea8ed4897988a44327fb9209f937f2956a7eed5a31b68507df10f02e953e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0e0ea0fe-3049-4010-b9a5-eda3af26718a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2f750da056c320f3bdd2b5303c9e5302b9587221477f2cfe28d0c683fc8e156a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statement under Ind AS251\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Value Creation for Stakeholders Statutory Reports and Financial Statements  d)  Business combinations:  In accounting for \nbusiness combinations, judgment is required \nto assess whether an identifiable intangible \nasset is to be recorded separately from goodwill. \nAdditionally, estimating the acquisition date \nfair value of the identifiable assets acquired \n(including useful life estimates), liabilities \nassumed, and contingent consideration \nassumed involves management judgment. \nThese measurements are based on information \navailable at the acquisition date and are based \non expectations and assumptions that have \nbeen deemed reasonable by management. \nChanges in these judgments, estimates, and \nassumptions can materially affect the results \nof operations. \n  e)\t\tDefined\t benefit\t plans\tand\tcompensated\t\nabsences: The cost of the defined benefit plans, \ncompensated absences and the present value \nof the defined benefit obligations are based \non actuarial valuation using the projected unit \ncredit method. An actuarial valuation involves \nmaking various assumptions that may differ \nfrom actual developments in the future. These \ninclude the determination of the discount \nrate, future salary increases and mortality \nrates.

For \nthese short-term and low-value leases, the \nCompany recognises the lease payments as an \noperating expense on a straight-line basis over \nthe lease term.\n  The cost of the RoU assets comprises the amount \nof the initial measurement of the lease liability, any \nlease payments made at or before the inception \ndate of the lease plus any initial direct costs, \nless any lease incentives received. Subsequently, \nthe RoU assets are measured at cost less any \naccumulated depreciation and accumulated \nimpairment losses, if any. The RoU assets are \ndepreciated using the straight-line method from \nthe commencement date over the shorter of lease \nterm or useful life of RoU assets. The estimated \nuseful lives of RoU assets are determined on \nthe same basis as those of property, plant and \nequipment.\n  The Company applies Ind AS 36 to determine \nwhether a RoU asset is impaired and accounts for \nany identified impairment loss as described in the \nimpairment of non-financial assets below.\n  For lease liabilities at the commencement of the \nlease, the Company measures the lease liability \nat the present value of the lease payments that \nare not paid at that date. The lease payments are \ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the \nlease, if that rate is readily determined, if that rate \nis not readily determined, the lease payments are \ndiscounted using the incremental borrowing rate \nthat the Company would have to pay to borrow \nfunds, including the consideration of factors such \nas the nature of the asset and location, collateral, \nmarket terms and conditions, as applicable in a \nsimilar economic environment. \n  After the commencement date, the amount \nof lease liabilities is increased to reflect the \naccretion of interest and reduced for the lease \npayments made.\n  The Company recognises the amount of the re-\nmeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the RoU assets. Where the carrying amount \nof the RoU asset is reduced to zero and there \nis a further reduction in the measurement of \nthe lease liability, the Company recognises any \nremaining amount of the re-measurement in the \nconsolidated statement of profit and loss.\n  Payment of lease liabilities are classified as cash \nused in financing activities in the consolidated \nstatement of cash flows.\n The Company as a lessor\n  Leases under which the Company is a lessor \nare classified as a finance or operating lease. \nLease contracts where all the risks and rewards \nare substantially transferred to the lessee, are \nclassified as a finance lease. All other leases are \nclassified as operating lease.\n  For leases under which the Company is an \nintermediate lessor, the Company accounts for \nthe head-lease and the sub-lease as two separate \ncontracts. The sub-lease is further classified \neither as a finance lease or an operating lease by \nreference to the RoU asset arising from the head-\nlease.\n (ix) Inventories \n   Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net \nrealisable value, including necessary provision \nfor obsolescence. Cost is determined using the \nweighted average method. \n (x) Impairment \n  a) Financial assets \n    The Company applies the expected credit loss \nmodel for recognising impairment loss on \nfinancial assets measured at amortised cost, \ndebt instruments classified as FVTOCI, trade \nreceivables, unbilled receivables, contract \nassets, finance lease receivables, and other \nfinancial assets. Expected credit loss is the \ndifference between the contractual cash flows \nand the cash flows that the entity expects to \nreceive, discounted using the effective interest \nrate. \n    Loss allowances for trade receivables, unbilled \nreceivables, contract assets and finance \nlease receivables are measured at an amount", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4258, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b96d15b4-5dc2-4f1a-9532-66b0366d98f5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b96d15b4-5dc2-4f1a-9532-66b0366d98f5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "251", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "46b0f7e0-1568-4ef1-9533-5a9ca9608245", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "251", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "eaf4c1daff02f77270efb82caea1154f1c23a2df301fd8933e679e63f76ffe90", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ab6ff890-e753-4892-b95e-08a8dcee5679", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "250", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "37fa17a6b267fce6ef0e93c4edf8af6427ae67bdf5ceb749042885b8f58eeb97", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8726202f-8dd8-48fe-93e3-e49ddf8e3d6d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5b8bc10a6c9c6e66eb7b09b127c8ce88c6effffa914d7c473a8e6363a8e52b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statement under Ind AS\nAmb itions  Realized .260\nReporting Context Our Capabilities Governance and Leadership Performance Overviewequal to lifetime expected credit loss. Lifetime \nexpected credit losses are the expected credit \nlosses that result from all possible default \nevents over the expected life of a financial \ninstrument. Lifetime expected credit loss is \ncomputed based on a provision matrix which \ntakes in to account, risk profiling of customers \nand historical credit loss experience adjusted \nfor forward looking information. For other \nfinancial assets, expected credit loss is \nmeasured at the amount equal to twelve \nmonths expected credit loss unless there has \nbeen a significant increase in credit risk from \ninitial recognition, in which case those are \nmeasured at lifetime expected credit loss. \n  b)\t Non-financial\tassets\t\n    The Company assesses long-lived assets such \nas property, plant and equipment, RoU assets \nand acquired intangible assets for impairment \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset or \ngroup of assets may not be recoverable. If any \nsuch indication exists, the Company estimates \nthe recoverable amount of the asset or group \nof assets.\n    Goodwill is tested for impairment at least \nannually at the same time and when events \noccur or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat the recoverable amount of the cash \ngenerating unit is less than its carrying value. \nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at \nthe level of cash-generating unit or groups of \ncash-generating units which represents the \nlowest level at which goodwill is monitored for \ninternal management purposes.\n    The recoverable amount of an asset or \ncash generating unit is the higher of its fair \nvalue less cost of disposal (\u201c FVLCD \u201d) and its \nvalue-in-use (\u201c VIU\u201d). The VIU of long-lived \nassets is calculated using projected future \ncash flows. FVLCD of a cash generating unit \nis computed using turnover and earnings \nmultiples. If the recoverable amount of the \nasset or the recoverable amount of the cash \ngenerating unit to which the asset belongs is \nless than its carrying amount, the carrying \namount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment \nloss and is recognised in the consolidated \nstatement of profit and loss. If at the reporting \ndate, there is an indication that a previously \nassessed impairment loss no longer exists, \nthe recoverable amount is reassessed and \nthe impairment losses previously recognised \nare reversed such that the asset is recognised \nat its recoverable amount but not exceeding \nwritten down value which would have been \nreported if the impairment losses had not \nbeen recognised initially.

(xiii)  Provisions \n   Provisions are recognised when the Company has \na present obligation (legal or constructive), as a \nresult of a past event, it is probable that an outflow \nof economic benefits will be required to settle the \nobligation and a reliable estimate can be made of \nthe amount of the obligation. \n   The amount recognised as a provision is the best \nestimate of the consideration required to settle \nthe present obligation at the end of the reporting \nperiod, considering the risks and uncertainties \nsurrounding the obligation. \n   When some or all of the economic benefits \nrequired to settle a provision are expected to be \nrecovered from a third party, the receivable is \nrecognised as an asset, if it is virtually certain that \nreimbursement will be received and the amount of \nthe receivable can be measured reliably. \n   Provisions for onerous contracts are recognised \nwhen the expected benefits to be derived by \nthe Company from a contract are lower than \nthe unavoidable costs of meeting the future \nobligations under the contract. Provisions for \nonerous contracts are measured at the present \nvalue of lower of the expected net cost of fulfilling \nthe contract and the expected cost of terminating \nthe contract. \n (xiv)  Revenue \n   The Company derives revenue primarily from \nsoftware development, maintenance of software/\nhardware and related services, consulting \nservices, business process services and sale of IT \nproducts. \n   Revenues from customer contracts are considered \nfor recognition and measurement when the \ncontract has been approved by the parties to the \ncontract, the parties to contract are committed \nto perform their respective obligations under the \ncontract, and the contract is legally enforceable. \nRevenue is recognised upon transfer of control \nof promised products or services to customers \nin an amount that reflects the consideration the \nCompany expects to receive (the \u201cTransaction \nPrice\u201d).

To recognise revenues, the Company \napplies the following five step approach:  \n(1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify \nthe performance obligations in the contract,  \n(3) determine the Transaction Price, (4) allocate the \nTransaction Price to the performance obligations \nin the contract, and (5) recognise revenues when \na performance obligation is satisfied. When \nthere is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue \nrecognition is postponed until such uncertainty is \nresolved.\n   At contract inception, the Company assesses \nits promise to transfer products or services to \na customer to identify separate performance \nobligations. The Company applies judgement \nto determine whether each product or service \npromised to a customer is capable of being \ndistinct, and are distinct in the context of the \ncontract, if not, the promised products or \nservices are combined and accounted as a single \nperformance obligation. The Company allocates \nthe Transaction Price to separately identifiable \nperformance obligations based on their relative \nstand-alone selling price or residual method. \nStand-alone selling prices are determined \nbased on sale prices for the components when \nit is regularly sold separately, in cases where the \nCompany is unable to determine the stand-alone \nselling price, the Company uses third-party prices \nfor similar deliverables or the Company uses \nexpected cost-plus margin approach in estimating \nthe stand-alone selling price.\n   For performance obligations where control is \ntransferred over time, revenues are recognised \nby measuring progress towards completion of \nthe performance obligation. The selection of the \nmethod to measure progress towards completion \nrequires judgment and is based on the nature of \nthe promised products or services to be provided.\n   The method for recognising revenues and costs \ndepends on the nature of the services rendered:\n  A. Time and materials contracts \n    Revenues and costs relating to time and \nmaterials contracts are recognised as the \nrelated services are rendered.   B. Fixed-price contracts\n   i. Fixed-price development contracts\n     Revenues from fixed-price development \ncontracts, including software \ndevelopment, and integration contracts, \nwhere the performance obligations are \nsatisfied over time, are recognised using \nthe \u201cpercentage-of-completion\u201d method. \nThe performance obligations are satisfied \nas and when the services are rendered \nsince the customer generally obtains \ncontrol of the work as it progresses. \nPercentage of completion is determined \nbased on project costs incurred to date \nas a percentage of total estimated \nproject costs required to complete the \nproject. The cost expended (or input) \nmethod has been used to measure \nprogress towards completion as there is \na direct relationship between input and \nproductivity. If the Company is not able \nto reasonably measure the progress of \ncompletion, revenue is recognised only \nto the extent of costs incurred for which \nrecoverability is probable. When total \ncost estimates exceed revenues in an \narrangement, the estimated losses are \nrecognised in the consolidated statement \nof profit and loss in the period in which \nsuch losses become probable based on \nthe current contract estimates as an \nonerous contract provision. \n     A contract asset is a right to consideration \nthat is conditional upon factors other \nthan the passage of time.

The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company\u2019s \nearnings and equity to losses. \n Risk Management Procedures \n  The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent \ncontrol over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk \nmanagement objectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities \nof this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency \nexposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies. \n Foreign currency risk \n  The Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. \nConsequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the \nUnited States of America and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. \nThe exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash \nflows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is in the U.S. \nDollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in \nIndian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years \nand may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the \nCompany\u2019s results of operations.\n  The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency \nderivative instruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including \nthe use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in \nforeign currency. \n  The Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange \nexposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.\n  As at March 31, 2023, a H 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the U.S. dollar would result in \napproximately H 3,360  (consolidated statement of profit and loss H 1,502 and other comprehensive income H 1,858) \ndecrease in the fair value, and a H 1 decrease would result in approximately H 3,341 (consolidated statement of profit and \nloss H 1,503 and other comprehensive income

approximately H 1,305 and H 1,210, respectively.\nInterest rate risk  \n Interest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate investments and borrowings, including various revolving and other \nlines of credit.\nThe Company\u2019s investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate \nrisk. The Company has taken certain interest rate swaps against its investments in floating rate instruments and if \ninterest rates were to increase/(decrease) by 100 bps as on March 31, 2023, it would result in (decrease)/increase in fair \nvalue of interest rate swaps by approximately  H (67) and H 69 respectively, in other comprehensive income.\n From time to time the Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into \ninterest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed \nupon fixed and floating interest rates. If interest rates were to increase/(decrease) by 100 bps as on March 31, 2023, it \nwould result in increase/(decrease) in fair value of interest rate swaps by approximately  H 329 and  H (340) respectively, \nin the consolidated statement of income. If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps as on March 31, 2023 and 2022, \nadditional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately  H 887 and 951, \nrespectively. Certain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates.\nCredit risk  \n Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.

This \nincludes contracts with a substantive enforceable \ntermination penalty if the contract is terminated \nwithout cause by the customer, based on an overall \nassessment of the contract carried out at the \ntime of inception. Historically, customers have not \nterminated contracts without cause.\n C.

Includes impact of foreign currency translation.\n  Deferred taxes on unrealised foreign exchange gain/loss relating to cash flow hedges, fair value movements in investments \nand remeasurements of the defined benefit plans are recognised in other comprehensive income. Deferred tax liability \non the intangible assets identified and carry forward losses on acquisitions is recorded by an adjustment to goodwill. \nOther than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the consolidated statement of \nprofit and loss. \n  In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the \ndeferred tax asset will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation \nof future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become \ndeductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income \nand tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that \nthe Company will realise the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered \nrealisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward \nperiod are reduced.\n  Deferred tax asset amounting to H 9,321 and H 8,017 as at March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively in respect of unused \ntax losses have not been recognised by the Company.

Accordingly, \ndeferred income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of subsidiaries amounting to H 108,274 and H 94,029 as at March \n31, 2023 and 2022, respectively and branch profit tax @ 15% of the US branch profit have not been recognised. Further, \nit is not practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognised deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.\n32.

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL DISCLOSURES  \n  The key objective of the Company\u2019s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with \nthe focus on total equity to uphold investor, creditor, and customer confidence and to ensure future development of its \nbusiness. The Company\u2019s focus is to keep strong total equity base to ensure independence, security, as well as a high \nfinancial flexibility for potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the risk profile of the Company.\n  The Company\u2019s goal is to continue to be able to return excess liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual \ndividends in future periods. The amount of future dividends/buyback of equity shares will be balanced with efforts to \ncontinue to maintain an adequate liquidity status.\n The capital structure as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nAs at  \nMarch 31, 2023As at  \nMarch 31, 2022% Change\nEquity attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company (A) \u00a0H 776,679\u00a0 \u00a0H 654,030\u00a0 18.8%\u00a0\nAs percentage of total capital 82% 79%\nCurrent borrowings 88,821\u00a0 95,233\u00a0\nNon-current borrowings 61,272\u00a0 56,463\u00a0\nLease liabilities 24,573\u00a0 24,233\u00a0\nTotal borrowings and lease liabilities (B) \u00a0H 174,666\u00a0 \u00a0H 175,929\u00a0 (0.7)%\u00a0\nAs percentage of total capital 18% 21%\nTotal capital (A) + (B) \u00a0H 951,345\u00a0 \u00a0H 829,959\u00a0 14.6%\u00a0\nBorrowings and Lease liabilities represents 18% and 21% of total capital as of March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

These amounts are net of \ncapital advances paid in respect of these purchases.\n Guarantees:  As at March 31, 2023 and 2022, guarantees provided by banks on behalf of the Company to the Indian \nGovernment, customers and certain other agencies amount to approximately H 16,076 and H 17 ,094 respectively, as part \nof the bank line of credit.\n Contingencies and lawsuits:  The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims resulting from tax assessment \norders/penalty notices issued under the Income tax Act, 1961, which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business. \nSome of the claims involve complex issues and it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial \neffect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of such proceedings. However, the resolution of these legal \nproceedings is not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of \nthe Company.\n The Company\u2019s assessments are completed for the years up to March 31, 2019.

As part of customer contract with Metro AG, the Company has acquired Metro-nom GmbH  (currently known as Wipro \nBusiness Solutions GmbH  ) and Metro Systems Romania S.R.L. (currently known as Wipro Technology Solutions S.R.L.), \nthe IT units of Metro AG in Germany and Romania, respectively, for a consideration of H 5,096. Considering the terms and \nconditions of the agreement, the Company has concluded that this transaction does not meet the definition of Business \nunder Ind AS 103 \u201cBusiness Combinations\u201d.  The transaction was consummated on April 1, 2021. The fair value of net \nassets acquired aggregating to H 4,691 is allocated to respective assets and liabilities. The excess of consideration paid, \nand net assets taken over is accounted as \u2018costs to obtain contract\u2019, which will be amortised over the tenure of the \ncontract as reduction in revenues.\n42.  The Indian Parliament has approved the Code on Social Security, 2020 which would impact the contributions by the \nCompany towards Provident Fund and Gratuity. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has released draft rules for \nthe Code on Social Security, 2020 on November 13, 2020, and has invited suggestions from stake holders which are \nunder active consideration by the Ministry. Based on an initial assessment by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries, \nthe additional impact on Provident Fund contributions by the Company and its Indian subsidiaries is not expected to \nbe material, whereas, the likely additional impact on Gratuity liability / contributions by the Company and its Indian \nsubsidiaries could be material. The Company and its Indian subsidiaries will complete their evaluation once the subject \nrules are notified and will give appropriate impact in the financial statements in the period in which, the Code becomes \neffective and the related rules to determine the financial impact are published.\n43.

Our responsibility is to express an \nopinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our \naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the \nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the \nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws \nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities \nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards \nof the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and \nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether the financial statements are free of material \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits \nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of \nmaterial misstatement of the financial statements, whether \ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond \nto those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test \nbasis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the \nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates \nmade by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our \naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCRITICAL AUDIT MATTER\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter \narising from the current-period audit of the financial \nstatements that were communicated or required to be \ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to \naccounts or disclosures that are material to the financial \nstatements and (2) involved our especially challenging, \nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of \ncritical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on \nthe financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, \nby communicating the critical audit matter below, providing \nseparate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the \naccounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nRevenue from fixed-price contracts using the percentage-\nof-completion method - Refer Notes 2 (iv)(a), 3(xiv)B and 24 \nto the financial statements. \nCritical Audit Matter Description  \nRevenue from fixed-price contracts, including software \ndevelopment, and integration contracts, where the \nperformance obligations are satisfied over time, is recognized \nusing the percentage-of-completion method. \nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the \nCompany to determine the project costs incurred to date as \na percentage of total estimated project costs at completion. \nThe estimation of total project costs involves significant \njudgment and is assessed throughout the period of the \ncontract to reflect any changes based on the latest available \ninformation. In addition, provisions for estimated losses, if \nany, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period \nin which such losses become probable based on the total \nestimated project costs. \nWe identified the revenue recognition for fixed-price \ncontracts where the percentage-of-completion method is \nused as a critical audit matter because of the significant \njudgment involved in estimating the efforts to complete \nsuch contracts. \nThis estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires \nconsideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred \nto-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the \nremaining performance obligations.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4967, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "aded094b-4a56-4371-8d67-ab2e5c3ae7b4": {"__data__": {"id_": "aded094b-4a56-4371-8d67-ab2e5c3ae7b4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "328", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84794fb0-41cd-4ad7-883b-d3e42465a9c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "328", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "03a8280e394d0e636aae494f42982299875c2c7899c2da4255f963c0fa43def2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "507f4721-ebb6-4ca4-96bc-0371dc80b560", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "328", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "86610f47017ac699a9be37856a682c41bf1a44de46531454593e6fe53c4757bf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "157bdb4c-32f6-4713-9dff-931494042c25", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d0214e54cbebfc7a2076c3e09a7f1ac95e877225b7ed2a871729b73fb51dcc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Use of the percentage-of-completion method requires the \nCompany to determine the project costs incurred to date as \na percentage of total estimated project costs at completion. \nThe estimation of total project costs involves significant \njudgment and is assessed throughout the period of the \ncontract to reflect any changes based on the latest available \ninformation.

\npercentage-of-completion method included the following, \namong others: \n\u2022 We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) \nrecording of efforts incurred and estimation of efforts \nrequired to complete the remaining performance \nobligations, and (2) access and application controls \npertaining to time recording and allocation systems, which \nprevents unauthorized changes to recording of efforts \nincurred.  \n\u2022 We selected a sample of fixed-price contracts with \ncustomers accounted using percentage-of-completion \nmethod and performed the following: \n\u2022 Read the contract and based on the terms and conditions \nevaluated whether recognizing revenue over time using \npercentage-of-completion method was appropriate, and the contract was included in management\u2019s calculation \nof revenue over time. \n\u2022 Evaluated the appropriateness of and consistency \nin the application of management\u2019s policies and \nmethodologies to estimate progress towards satisfying \nthe performance obligation. \n\u2022 Compared efforts incurred to date with Company\u2019s \nestimate of efforts incurred to date to identify significant \nvariations and evaluate whether those variations \nhave been considered appropriately in estimating the \nremaining efforts to complete the contract. \n\u2022 Tested the estimate for consistency with the status of

Due to rounding off, \nthe numbers presented throughout the document may not add up precisely to the totals and \npercentages may not precisely reflect the absolute \nfigures. Previous year figures have been regrouped/\nrearranged, wherever necessary.\n (ii) Basis of measurement \n   The consolidated financial statements have been \nprepared on a historical cost convention and on \nan accrual basis, except for the following material \nitems which have been measured at fair value as \nrequired by relevant IFRS:\n  a. Derivative financial instruments;\n  b.  Financial instruments classified as fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income or fair \nvalue through profit or loss; \n  c.  The defined benefit liability/(asset) is \nrecognized as the present value of defined \nbenefit obligation less fair value of plan \nassets; and \n  d.  Contingent consideration.\n (iii) Convenience translation (unaudited) \n   The accompanying consolidated financial \nstatements have been prepared and reported \nin Indian rupees, the functional currency of the \nParent Company. Solely for the convenience of the \nreaders, the consolidated financial statements \nas at and for the year ended March 31, 2023, have \nbeen translated into United States dollars at the \ncertified foreign exchange rate of $1 = H 82.19 as \npublished by Federal Reserve Board of Governors \non March 31, 2023. No representation is made that \nthe Indian rupee amounts have been, could have \nbeen or could be converted into United States \ndollars at such a rate or any other rate. Due to \nrounding off, the translated numbers presented \nthroughout the document may not add up precisely \nto the totals. \n (iv) Use of estimates and judgment \n   The preparation of the consolidated financial \nstatements in conformity with IFRS requires the \nmanagement to make judgments, accounting \nestimates and assumptions that affect the \napplication of accounting policies and the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, income, and \nexpenses. Accounting estimates are monetary \n(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statement under IFRS\nAmb itions  Realized .\n348\nReporting Context Our Capabilities Governance and Leadership Performance Overview", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4324, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cf03b5c1-a4f5-402e-97b6-ef7ce1cdfa5a": {"__data__": {"id_": "cf03b5c1-a4f5-402e-97b6-ef7ce1cdfa5a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "340", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "61c70bf5-f93f-43e8-ba26-ddc80ac7d136", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "340", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "4998d796860ec5abc9b20b9079681f54fee04de7866de72d8a78dd324b1bd8a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "13a6fbe8-ef5b-4bea-8a63-dcb795b7e6f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "339", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "eebedf2d8b5e0fd5611c30ce1fef7bc01fffdbc5c0a87940ba54281ed843f1e9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ddde3396-fba2-44e6-96e6-1325e60249a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2df810cc25d4e9e6d8143839758028f13ad4fc999ae83f287350e1ecd638e6df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "amounts in the consolidated financial statements \nthat are subject to measurement uncertainty. An \naccounting policy may require items in consolidated \nfinancial statements to be measured at monetary \namounts that cannot be observed directly and must \ninstead be estimated. In such a case, management \ndevelops an accounting estimate to achieve \nthe objective set out by the accounting policy. \nDeveloping accounting estimates involves the use \nof judgments or assumptions based on the latest \navailable and reliable information. Actual results \nmay differ from those accounting estimates.\n   Accounting estimates and underlying assumptions \nare reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to \naccounting estimates are recognized in the period \nin which the estimates are changed and in any \nfuture periods affected. In particular, information \nabout material areas of estimation, uncertainty \nand critical judgments in applying accounting \npolicies that have the material effect on the \namounts recognized in the consolidated financial \nstatements are included in the following notes:\n  a)   Revenue recognition:  The Company applies \njudgment to determine whether each product \nor service promised to a customer is capable \nof being distinct, and is distinct in the context \nof the contract, if not, the promised product \nor service is combined and accounted as a \nsingle performance obligation. The Company \nallocates the Transaction Price (as defined \nbelow) to separately identifiable performance \nobligation deliverables based on their \nrelative stand-alone selling price. In cases \nwhere the Company is unable to determine \nthe stand-alone selling price, the Company \nuses expected cost-plus margin approach in \nestimating the stand-alone selling price. The \nCompany uses the percentage of completion \nmethod using the input (cost expended) \nmethod to measure progress towards \ncompletion in respect of fixed-price contracts. \nPercentage of completion method accounting \nrelies on estimates of total expected contract \nrevenue and costs. This method is followed \nwhen reasonably dependable estimates of \nthe revenues and costs applicable to various \nelements of the contract can be made. Key \nfactors that are reviewed in estimating the future costs to complete include estimates \nof future labor costs and productivity \nefficiencies. Because the financial reporting of \nthese contracts depends on estimates that are \nassessed continually during the term of these \ncontracts, revenue recognized, profit and \ntiming of revenue for remaining performance \nobligations are subject to revisions as the \ncontract progresses to completion. When \nestimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, \nthe loss is provided for in the period in which \nthe loss becomes probable. Volume discounts \nare recorded as a reduction of revenue. When \nthe amount of discount varies with the levels \nof revenue, volume discount is recorded \nbased on estimate of future revenue from \nthe customer. \n  b)  Impairment testing:  Goodwill recognized \non business combination is tested for \nimpairment at least annually and when events \noccur or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat the recoverable amount of goodwill or \na cash generating unit to which goodwill \npertains, is less than the carrying value. \nThe Company assesses acquired intangible \nassets with finite useful life for impairment \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances \nindicate that the carrying amount may not \nbe recoverable. The recoverable amount of \nan asset or a cash generating unit is higher \nof value-in-use and fair value less cost of \ndisposal. The calculation of value in use of an \nasset or a cash generating unit involves use of \nsignificant estimates and assumptions which \ninclude turnover, growth rates and net margins \nused to calculate projected future cash flows, \nrisk-adjusted discount rate, future economic \nand market conditions. \n  c)  Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for \nthe Company are India and the United States \nof America. \n    Significant judgments are involved in \ndetermining the provision for income taxes \nincluding judgment on whether tax positions \nare probable of being sustained in tax \nassessments. A tax assessment can involve \ncomplex issues, which can only be resolved \nover extended time periods. \n(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statement under IFRS\n349\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Value Creation for Stakeholders Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4575, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddde3396-fba2-44e6-96e6-1325e60249a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddde3396-fba2-44e6-96e6-1325e60249a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "341", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d0bc370e-4277-4948-a651-95aab3869889", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "341", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c7485247163be409ecdb9519784ac5df2e2d15e768e87b290678432e6572bef4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cf03b5c1-a4f5-402e-97b6-ef7ce1cdfa5a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "340", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "4998d796860ec5abc9b20b9079681f54fee04de7866de72d8a78dd324b1bd8a1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "04623667-cebb-46cc-a986-190b1f15ff4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "92eabf55a93d71a548a919d7c45e226ac3b37d5af5b5b7cf3a1105bb493692cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Deferred tax is recorded on temporary \ndifferences between the tax bases of assets \nand liabilities and their carrying amounts, \nat the rates that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted at the reporting date. \nThe ultimate realization of deferred tax \nassets is dependent upon the generation of \nfuture taxable profits during the periods in \nwhich those temporary differences and tax \nloss carry-forwards become deductible. The \nCompany considers expected reversal of \ndeferred tax liabilities and projected future \ntaxable income in making this assessment. \nThe amount of deferred tax assets considered \nrealizable, however, could reduce in the near \nterm if estimates of future taxable income \nduring the carry-forward period are reduced. \n  d)  Business combinations:  In accounting \nfor business combinations, judgment is \nrequired to assess whether an identifiable \nintangible asset is to be recorded separately \nfrom goodwill. Additionally, estimating the \nacquisition date fair value of the identifiable \nassets acquired (including useful life \nestimates), liabilities assumed, and contingent \nconsideration assumed involves management \njudgment. These measurements are based \non information available at the acquisition \ndate and are based on expectations and \nassumptions that have been deemed \nreasonable by management. Changes in these \njudgments, estimates, and assumptions can \nmaterially affect the results of operations. \n  e)\t\tDefined\tbenefit\tplans\tand\tcompensated \t\nabsences:  The cost of the defined benefit \nplans, compensated absences and the \npresent value of the defined benefit \nobligations are based on actuarial valuation \nusing the projected unit credit method. An \nactuarial valuation involves making various \nassumptions that may differ from actual \ndevelopments in the future. These include \nthe determination of the discount rate, future \nsalary increases and mortality rates. Due \nto the complexities involved in the valuation \nand its long-term nature, a defined benefit \nobligation is highly sensitive to changes in \nthese assumptions. All assumptions are \nreviewed at each reporting date.   f)\t\tExpected\t credit\tlosses\ton\tfinancial\t assets:\t\nThe impairment provisions of financial assets \nare based on assumptions about risk of \ndefault and expected timing of collection. \nThe Company uses judgment in making these \nassumptions and selecting the inputs to the \nexpected credit loss calculation based on the \nCompany\u2019s history of collections, customer\u2019s \ncreditworthiness, existing market conditions \nas well as forward looking estimates at the \nend of each reporting period.  \n  g)  Useful lives of property, plant and \nequipment:  The Company depreciates \nproperty, plant and equipment on a straight-\nline basis over estimated useful lives of the \nassets. The charge in respect of periodic \ndepreciation is derived based on an estimate \nof an asset\u2019s expected useful life and the \nexpected residual value at the end of its life. \nThe lives are based on historical experience \nwith similar assets as well as anticipation of \nfuture events, which may impact their life, \nsuch as changes in technology. The estimated \nuseful life is reviewed at least annually.\n  h)  Useful lives of intangible assets:  The \nCompany amortizes intangible assets on a \nstraight-line basis over estimated useful lives \nof the assets. The useful life is estimated based \non a number of factors including the effects of \nobsolescence, demand, competition and other \neconomic factors such as the stability of the \nindustry and known technological advances \nand the level of maintenance expenditures \nrequired to obtain the expected future cash \nflows from the assets. The estimated useful \nlife is reviewed at least annually.\n  i)  Provisions and contingent liabilities: The \nCompany estimates the provisions that have \npresent obligations as a result of past events \nand it is probable that outflow of resources \nwill be required to settle the obligations. These \nprovisions are reviewed at the end of each \nreporting date and are adjusted to reflect the \ncurrent best estimates.\n    The Company uses significant judgment to \ndisclose contingent liabilities.

MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICY INFORMATION \n (i) Basis of consolidation \n  Subsidiaries and controlled trusts\n   The Company determines the basis of control in \nline with the requirements of IFRS 10, Consolidated \nFinancial Statements . Subsidiaries and controlled \ntrusts are entities controlled by the Group. The \nGroup controls an entity when the parent has power \nover the entity, it is exposed to, or has rights to, \nvariable returns from its involvement with the entity \nand has the ability to affect those returns through \nits power over the entity. The financial statements \nof subsidiaries and controlled trusts are included \nin the consolidated financial statements from the \ndate on which control commences until the date on \nwhich control ceases.\n   The financial statements of the Group companies \nare consolidated on a line-by-line basis and all \nintra-Group balances, transactions, income and \nexpenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. \n   Non-controlling interests \n   Non-controlling interests in the net assets \n(excluding goodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries \nare identified separately from the Company\u2019s \nequity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders \nmay be initially measured either at fair value or \nat the non-controlling interest\u2019s proportionate \nshare of the fair value of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable \nnet assets. The choice of measurement basis \nis made on an acquisition to acquisition basis. \nSubsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount \nof non-controlling interests is the amount of \nthose interests at initial recognition plus the non-\ncontrolling interest\u2019s share of subsequent changes \nin equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if it results in the \nnon-controlling interests having a deficit balance. \n   Investments accounted for using the equity \nmethod\n   Investments accounted for using the equity \nmethod are entities in respect of which, the \nCompany has significant influence, but not control, \nover the financial and operating policies. Generally, \na Company has a significant influence if it holds \nbetween 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of \nanother entity. Investments in such entities are \naccounted for using the equity method and are \ninitially recognized at cost. The carrying amount of \ninvestment is increased/ decreased to recognize \ninvestors share of profit or loss of the investee after \nthe acquisition date.\n   Non-current assets and disposal groups held \nfor sale\n   Assets and liabilities of disposal groups that are \navailable for immediate sale and where the sale \nis highly probable of being completed within one \nyear from the date of classification are considered \nand classified as assets held for sale and liabilities \nassociated with assets held for sale. Non-current \nassets and disposal groups held for sale are \nmeasured at the lower of carrying amount and fair \nvalue less costs to sell.\n (ii) Functional and presentation currency \n   Items included in the financial statements of each \nof the Company\u2019s entities are measured using the \ncurrency of the primary economic environment in \nwhich these entities operate (i.e. the \u201cfunctional \ncurrency\u201d). These consolidated financial \nstatements are presented in Indian rupees, which \nis the functional currency of the Parent Company.\n (iii)  Foreign currency transactions and \ntranslation \n  a) Transactions and balances \n    Transactions in foreign currency are translated \ninto the respective functional currencies using \nthe exchange rates prevailing at the date of \nthe transaction. Foreign exchange gains and \nlosses resulting from the settlement of such \ntransactions and from translation at the \nexchange rates prevailing at the reporting \n(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Financial Statement under IFRS\n351\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Value Creation for Stakeholders Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4477, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b02bff57-2129-4985-b860-4ca4bcd8c4e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "b02bff57-2129-4985-b860-4ca4bcd8c4e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "343", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "eecdfd15-1dae-49a7-a5f5-acfc2e85ae0a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "343", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d64e620f5a207b09e2dccc15e4831fd234d179407d075d5d9310c7cffb25c96e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "04623667-cebb-46cc-a986-190b1f15ff4a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "342", "file_name": "wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10100955, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "a2b0e059436c7bfa3893407248b74d84ccc22e10ed336e36ca06ed87c6bba4a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "80d380da-f648-4d54-8b2d-d804446bab60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3f6838bde1c7e345ff33da3a83ce0c01fa2885c4c916b31f2016c1df590675b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "date of monetary assets and liabilities \ndenominated in foreign currencies are \nrecognized in the consolidated statement of \nincome and reported within foreign exchange \ngains/(losses), net, within results of operating \nactivities except when deferred in other \ncomprehensive income as qualifying cash \nflow hedges and qualifying net investment \nhedges.

For \nthese short-term and low-value leases, the \nCompany recognizes the lease payments as an \noperating expense on a straight-line basis over \nthe lease term.\n   The cost of the RoU assets comprises the \namount of the initial measurement of the lease \nliability, any lease payments made at or before \nthe inception date of the lease plus any initial \ndirect costs, less any lease incentives received. \nSubsequently, the RoU assets are measured \nat cost less any accumulated depreciation and \naccumulated impairment losses, if any.

Revenue towards satisfaction of a \nperformance obligation is measured at the \namount of the Transaction Price (net of variable \nconsideration on account of discounts and \nallowances) allocated to that performance \nobligation. To recognize revenues, the Company \napplies the following five step approach: (1) \nidentify the contract with a customer, (2) identify \nthe performance obligations in the contract, (3) \ndetermine the Transaction Price, (4) allocate the \nTransaction Price to the performance obligations \nin the contract, and (5) recognize revenues when \na performance obligation is satisfied. When \nthere is uncertainty as to collectability, revenue \nrecognition is postponed until such uncertainty \nis resolved.\n   At contract inception, the Company assesses \nits promise to transfer products or services to \na customer to identify separate performance \nobligations. The Company applies judgment \nto determine whether each product or service \npromised to a customer is capable of being \ndistinct, and are distinct in the context of the \ncontract, if not, the promised products or \nservices are combined and accounted as a single \nperformance obligation. The Company allocates \nthe Transaction Price to separately identifiable \nperformance obligations based on their relative \nstand-alone selling price or residual method. \nStand-alone selling prices are determined \nbased on sale prices for the components when \nit is regularly sold separately, in cases where \nthe Company is unable to determine the stand-\nalone selling price, the Company uses third-party \nprices for similar deliverables or the Company \nuses expected cost-plus margin approach in \nestimating the stand-alone selling price.\n   For performance obligations where control is \ntransferred over time, revenues are recognized \nby measuring progress towards completion of \nthe performance obligation.

Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the time of sale based on the carrying \nvalue of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash \nflow and liquidity for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 is not material.\n Financial risk management \n Market Risk\n  Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in \nthe price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest \nrates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market \nrisk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, \npayables and loans and borrowings.\n  The Company\u2019s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating \nactivities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company\u2019s \nearnings and equity to losses.\n Risk Management Procedures \n   The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent \ncontrol over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk \nmanagement objectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities of \nthis department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, \nborrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies. \n Foreign currency risk \n  The Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently, \nthe Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States \nof America and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange \nrate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and \nforeign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound \nSterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The \nexchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to \nfluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of \noperations.\n  The Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters foreign currency derivative \ninstruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including the use \nof derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign \ncurrency. \n  The Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange \nexposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.\n  As at March 31, 2023, a H 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the U.S. dollar would result in \napproximately H 3,360 (consolidated statement of income H 1,502 and other comprehensive income H 1,858) decrease \nin the fair value, and a H 1 decrease would result in approximately H 3,341 (consolidated statement of income H 1,503 \nand other comprehensive income H 1,838) increase in the fair value of foreign currency dollar denominated derivative \ninstruments (forward and option contracts).\n(C in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the

and borrowings, including various revolving and other \nlines of credit. \n  The Company\u2019s investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate

If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps as on March 31, 2022, and 2023, \nadditional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately H 951 and H 887, \nrespectively. Certain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates.\n Credit risk\n  Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage \nthis, the Company periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial \ncondition, current economic trends, forward looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and \nageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. No single customer accounted for more than 10% \nof the accounts receivable as at March 31, 2022 and 2023, or revenues for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023. \nThere is no significant concentration of credit risk. \n Counterparty risk\n  Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market \ncontracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities which are at least \nAA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into \ntransactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure \nto these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure \nto any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial \nstatements and capital adequacy ratio reviews. \n Liquidity risk \n  Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a \nreasonable price. The Company\u2019s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as \nsettlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. \nManagement monitors the Company\u2019s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts based on the expected cash flows. As \nat March 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.\n  The table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities at the \nreporting date.

Deferred \ntax liability on the intangible assets identified and carry forward losses on acquisitions is recorded by an adjustment \nto goodwill. Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the consolidated \nstatement of income. \nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the \ndeferred tax asset will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation \nof future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become \ndeductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income \nand tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that \nthe Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered \nrealizable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward \nperiod are reduced.\nDeferred tax asset amounting to H 8,017 and H 9,321 as at March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively in respect of unused tax \nlosses have not been recognized by the Company. The tax loss carry-forwards of H 32,117 and H 38,564 as at March 31, 2022 \nand 2023, respectively, on which deferred tax asset has not been recognized by the Company, because it is probable that \nfuture taxable profits will not be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future. \nApproximately, H 29,993, and H 35,621 as at March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, of these tax loss carry-forwards is not \ncurrently subject to expiration dates. The remaining tax loss carry-forwards of approximately H 2,124 and H 2,943 as at \nMarch 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, expires in various years through fiscal year 2042.\nThe Company has recognized deferred tax assets of H 2,144 and H 2,624 primarily in respect of carry forward losses \nincluding certain subsidiaries as at March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Management\u2019s projections of future taxable \nincome and tax planning strategies support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be \navailable to utilize these deferred tax assets.\nWe have calculated our domestic tax liability under normal provisions.

The excess tax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward \nfor a period of fifteen years and set-off against future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions.\nA substantial portion of the profits of the Company\u2019s India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits \nattributable to export operations and profits from units established under the Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme. \nUnits in designated special economic zones providing service on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction \nof 100 percent of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of \nprovision of services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years. 50% tax deduction is available for a \nfurther five years subject to the unit meeting certain defined conditions. Profits from certain other undertakings are also \neligible for preferential tax treatment. New Special Economic Zone units set up on or after April 1, 2021 are not eligible for \nthe aforesaid deduction. The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through \nfiscal 2034-35. The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of H 11,458, H 16,483 and H \n16,718 for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we \nestimate the Company would have been required to pay if these incentives had not been available. The per share effect \nof these tax incentives for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 was H 2.03, H 3.02, and H 3.05, respectively.\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary \ndifferences associated with investments in subsidiaries where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can \nbe controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, \ndeferred income tax liabilities on cumulative earnings of subsidiaries amounting to H 94,029 and H 108,724 as at March \n31, 2022 and 2023, respectively and branch profit tax @ 15% of the US branch profit have not been recognized. Further, \nit is not practicable to estimate the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for these undistributed earnings.\n22.  DIVIDENDS AND BUYBACK OF EQUITY SHARES\nThe Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees. According to the Companies Act, 2013 any dividend should \nbe declared out of accumulated distributable profits. A Company may, before the declaration of any dividend, transfer a \npercentage of its profits for that financial year as it may consider appropriate to the reserves.\nThe cash dividends paid per equity share were H 1, H 1 and H 6 (including H 5 declared on March 25, 2022), during the years \nended March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company concluded the buyback of 237 ,500,000 equity shares as approved by \nthe Board of Directors on October 13, 2020. This has resulted in a total cash outflow of H 116,445 (including tax on buyback \nof H 21,445). In line with the requirement of the Companies Act, 2013, an amount of H 1,427 and H 115,018 has been utilized \nfrom share premium and retained earnings respectively. Further, capital redemption reserve (included in other reserves) \nof H 475 (representing the nominal value of the shares bought back) has been created as an apportionment from retained \nearnings. Consequent to such buyback, the paid-up equity share capital has reduced by H 475.\n23.  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL DISCLOSURES\nThe key objective of the Company\u2019s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a stable capital structure with \nthe focus on total equity to uphold investor, creditor, and customer confidence and to ensure future development of its \nbusiness. The Company\u2019s focus is to keep strong total equity base to ensure independence, security, as well as a high \nfinancial flexibility for potential future borrowings, if required without impacting the risk profile of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s goal is to continue to be able to return excess liquidity to shareholders by continuing to distribute annual \ndividends in future periods.

Remaining Performance Obligations\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been \nrecognized, which includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future \nperiods. Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers \nin an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to \ndate, which are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based. \nAs at March 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023, the aggregate amount of the Transaction Price allocated to remaining \nperformance obligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were H 384,881, H 328,191 and \nH 317,612, respectively of which approximately 59%, 59% and 66%, respectively is expected to be recognized as \nrevenues within two years, and the remainder thereafter. This includes contracts with a substantive enforceable \ntermination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause by the customer, based on an overall assessment of \nthe contract carried out at the time of inception. Historically, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.\n C. Disaggregation of Revenue\nThe tables below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment (refer to Note \n34 \u201cSegment Information\u201d), sector and nature of contract.
