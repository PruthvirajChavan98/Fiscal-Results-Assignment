From a talent perspective, the employee strength grew to over 614,000 associates with 35.7% women associates.\nThe global environment is going through considerable changes. \nGeopolitical factors such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, rising inflation and volatile commodity prices have caused slowing down of global growth and created stress in the overall economic environment. \nAt the same time, the world is navigating several transitions. \nUndoubtedly, these transitions will require significant investments in technology and innovation, and offer a huge growth opportunity for the IT industry.\nThe global energy transition  is accelerating. Businesses are \nmaking clear commitments towards a sustainable future. \nThere are many  innovations across products, services, manufacturing, and delivery. New business models are also emerging. This requires investments in technology and innovation including electric mobility, renewable power, hydrogen and sustainable fuel. In addition, sustainability compliance and reporting requirements are fast evolving as new standards and regulations are coming into play. Across the facets of this transition, investments in IT and digital technology will be an important enabler for businesses.\nThe supply chain  transition  resulting from the geo-political \nsituation is altering the global supply chains. Companies are \nrebalancing their supply chains for resilience and efficiency. New global supply chain ecosystems are being created with India playing an important role. This is being led by significant capital investments in technology to set-up \u2018digital-first\u2019 manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as to build ecosystem integration with partners.\nIn the past decade, there has been a rapid evolution of digital \ntechnologies, bringing about a transformation across every industry. Now, the advancements in AI have made AI transition a central focus. The impact of AI and Machine learning is going to be profound. There is a transition already underway from predictive AI to generative AI. Majority of the businesses are still adopting predictive AI and are on the journey of capturing large volume of data, harnessing the power of cloud and IoT. There are varying levels of adoption in companies across sectors. Leveraging generative AI would further require technology innovation and investments. \nThere is another important area that companies need to focus \non \u2013 building talent for the future. The energy, supply chain and AI transitions are going to require companies to reskill/upskill existing talent base, hire and integrate new talent and invest in research. Our technology strengths make us well-placed to respond to the global demand and scale up our talent base. \nAs the future of work is evolving, enterprises globally are also \nassessing their approach to talent. Today, companies can tap into talent anywhere and leaders need to learn how to harness the global talent pool effectively. Technology and tools are facilitating collaboration and enabling virtual and hybrid models of work. Harnessing this talent will need an approach that leverages technologies like AI and cloud to enable effective employee engagement and collaboration. \nYour company is significantly investing in building AI capabilities \nwhich include products and platforms that are AI-powered. Over the last few years, your company has leveraged partnerships to design and orchestrate a completely indigenous software-defined 4G/5G network stack. 5G technologies along with IoT, edge and AI will enable new digital transformation opportunities across industries, both industrial and consumer. We will also invest in research areas important for the future, in collaboration with our global academic partners and start-up ecosystem. \nI would like to thank Rajesh Gopinathan for his contribution \nduring his tenure as CEO & MD and I wish him the very best for the future. I also take this opportunity to wish K Krithivasan the very best in his new role as CEO & MD of your company. \nOn behalf of the Board of Directors of Tata Consultancy Services, \nI want to thank you for your continued trust, confidence, and support.\nWarm regards,\nN ChandrasekaranChairman\nLetter from the Chairman  |  7", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5215, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "efe0b0f1-1a66-4510-b54e-465d75ed666c": {"__data__": {"id_": "efe0b0f1-1a66-4510-b54e-465d75ed666c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d00274c4-7d40-4e95-a52b-f2f6bf68fe6e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "8b31414405ea406ae4d3b8676ca38a1cbe9d2f0050c491659b9793263c95e1c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c6b43c84-8dac-4b8e-a9e9-004c9de0960f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "ecfd9b780492a29e051f7024ba05f7a7fa43f5ac918f17596645d033237e8b4a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c20b905d-903a-499e-aa91-8ec49a75c717", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "69e62501951ce3a5d4043bcd90fc23ab5b5ea2c3de942c9b56f8aaad05a39fea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Our full services capability enables us to help our clients thrive, \nin good times and bad.

Our investments in research and innovation across different industries, and our Pace innovation architecture have positioned us well to partner with them in these initiatives. Our Agile Innovation Cloud offering, where we create dedicated, location-independent innovation teams to help clients accelerate and scale up their innovation, gained further traction in FY 2023. 7 new clients signed up during the year, bringing the total to 30 clients. \nSome of the emerging innovation themes that we helped \ncustomers with include ecosystem and multi-industry models underpinned by technologies like data marketplaces, API and blockchain, in industries like transportation and public sector; AI-powered autonomous robotics in the logistics industry, and new applications for digital twins in the BFSI, Telecom and Retail industries. \nWithin our growth and transformation (G&T) portfolio, business \nmodel innovation continued to be a key theme. For example, for a large Fortune 500 electric gas utility, we built the service delivery platform central to their new business model of providing warranty repair, refurbishment and replacement services of various home appliances to households. \nIngram Micro, one of the largest technology distributors in \nthe US, engaged us as a partner to power their pivot into e-commerce and achieve their mission to transform from a traditional distributor to a platform company that does distribution. Tapestry Inc, a leading New York-based house \nof iconic accessories and lifestyle brands such as Coach, Kate Spade, & Stuart Weitzman, partnered with TCS to drive their omnichannel modernization and transform the customer journey experience.\nOther G&T themes, such as M&A and sustainability continued to \nbring in high-profile deal wins and new strategic engagements for us in FY 2023. Elsewhere in this report, you can read about the work we did for Philips Domestic Appliances in its journey to be a standalone company, and how we helped Eversource \nEnergy pursue its carbon neutrality aspirations.\nDigital transformation, which began in the front office, towards \nenhancing customer experience, made further inroads within the enterprise during the year, unlocking tremendous value in the middle and back office. As critical technologies such as machine vision and conversational systems get better with the use of AI, our Machine First\u2122 approach is helping clients use them innovatively in the back office, embedding them into reimagined processes to drive greater velocity, agility, throughput and resilience \u2013 which, among other things, also enhances customer experience.The supplyside challenges of the last two years peaked in the first half of FY 2023, with employee churn reaching unprecedented levels. We broke out of the vicious cycle of hiring and counter-hiring within the industry by investing in onboarding an unprecedent number of fresh engineers \u2013 over 110,000  in \nFY 2022 and over 44,000  in FY 2023 \u2013 and training them on the \ntechnologies most in demand. Newer developments like generative AI, large language models, and quantum computing triggered more experimentation and innovation by our clients. Our investments in research and innovation across different industries, and our Pace innovation architecture have positioned us well to partner with them in these initiatives. \nApplied at scale, across a broad set of business or IT operations, this can result in an entirely new operating model that significantly boosts our clients\u2019 competitiveness. As macroeconomic uncertainty increased in the second half of the year, we saw clients adapting by reprioritizing their spends and showing greater interest in such operating model transformations. \nTCS Cognix\u2122, our AI-driven human machine collaboration suite, \nhas been a game changer, enabling faster transformations that deliver concrete business benefits within months. Its 600 pre-built configurable and reusable digital solutions enable plug and play transformation of a range of business and technology functions, horizontal and vertical. Nearly 300 of our clients have used it to transform their business and IT operations. \nIn traditional outsourcing deals, we saw more multi-services \nintegrated deals. By consolidating multiple elements of the operation stack \u2013 processes, applications, and the underlying technology and infrastructure \u2013 with a single strategic partner, clients not only achieve greater accountability, but also reduce complexity and derisk their larger business transformations. The same rationale is driving more vendor consolidation initiatives that favor a few strategic partners with end-to-end service offerings, the right innovation capabilities and scale.\nAll these trends play to our strengths. Our scale, structure, and \nability to bring together different capabilities into a seamless service delivery team, helped us win several large deals throughout the year. \nLetter to Shareholders  |  9", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5424, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8b42d71c-64f8-495b-b94b-6dca1cd39ae9": {"__data__": {"id_": "8b42d71c-64f8-495b-b94b-6dca1cd39ae9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3db00f3c-d17f-4e24-97d8-c4eef5ffe980", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "3e76de33980e031c1eb8419dd1e60bf66439fc5efad27c4cfc82d3f73377cfe5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c20b905d-903a-499e-aa91-8ec49a75c717", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "deaa72264e68affea4919e1adf0180ad88743f6542fc0e953d43575556da69ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b103289a-7f01-4d5f-a6f3-cb76769a69c9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e6654bc15bdde3a8d48212135e3d890cc1431187a1199c8e9b17cdd55a2b1d95", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "So long, farewell\nThis year marks a key milestone in my journey with TCS, and \nan important transition point for the company, as I step down from my role as CEO and MD on 31st May 2023.

So when health-tech giant Royal Philips sold Philips Domestic Appliances in 2021 to Hillhouse, a private equity firm, the standalone company, rebranded as Versuni, saw the separation as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to wipe the slate clean and transform into a digitally lean, agile, and innovation-led organization. \nVersuni partnered with TCS in its transformation journey from \nstrategy through execution, with a vision to embed insights and agility into core processes, enabling shorter time to value and quicker responses to market changes through a new cloud-first application landscape. The program entailed decoupling the company from the parent\u2019s systems, while simultaneously transforming it across all business domains, within an ambitious 2-year timeframe.\nThe business transformation, enabled by SAP as the digital core, \nestablishes best practices-based processes from the consumer products industry and simplified ways of working to drive speed, agility and insights-led decision-making.\nTCS enabled Versuni\u2019s strategies for driving revenue growth \nopportunities and innovative product launches. The new processes support Versuni\u2019s journey to develop products made with more sustainable materials, that are easier to repair, refurbish, recycle, and help to reduce waste. \nEnhancements were made to deliver superior business \noutcomes across every function. Integrating supply chain planning with factory scheduling will enable higher warehouse productivity and more timely shipments. AI-powered insights in finance will help improve cash flow, free up cash and drive efficiencies in back-office functions. The new people processes will provide a better employee experience and enable a more responsive HR function.\nPartnering with TCS helped Versuni deploy a new digital \nfoundation and operate as an independent entity. The new fit-for-purpose stack enables Versuni to more effectively respond to the fast-changing demands of the consumer products market, and pursue its vision of turning houses into homes, and building lifetime engagement with consumers. \nI am really happy to have partnered with TCS in this journey. TCS has been an invaluable partner in our process and digital transformation journey with SAP as the main enabling technology suite.

Leaders in the sector are using technology innovatively to draw environmentally conscious consumers looking for greener choices, and grow their new clean energy businesses. \nEversource Energy is a Fortune 500 energy company that \noperates New England\u2019s largest energy delivery system, with 4.4 million customers across Connecticut (CT), Massachusetts (MA) and New Hampshire. It is focused on making its operations carbon neutral by 2030, and bringing more clean and affordable energy to New England.\nEversource partnered with TCS to build a solution that \nwould help them on-board distributed solar power capacity within its grid by purchasing power from residential, industrial and commercial customers who install solar panels and storage on their properties, and enabling them to avail of incentives offered by their respective states, as part of state-level Net Zero programs. \nThe TCS-built solution includes onboarding \nof new solar customers, a customer application that helps keep track of the units generated, and a pricing engine that uses a declining block pricing mechanism to incentivize early enrolment as a producer. It also includes a billing system that processes recovery charges, solar credits and incentive payments, and enables flexible payment options as well as hardship relief options to improve affordability and increase adoption of energy efficiency programs.\nTo facilitate quick roll outs across states, TCS \narchitected a reusable framework that would simplify adoption of each state\u2019s incentive program into Eversource\u2019s core platform, enabling the utility to pursue a very aggressive implementation schedule for each state.\nUsing this solution, Eversource has been able to leverage \nstate incentives to make green energy affordable and rapidly benefit nearly 430,000 customers in CT and MA so far, while driving growth of its clean energy business. At the same time, it is projected to produce over 9,700 MWh of solar power, accelerating not only its own journey to carbon neutrality but also that of the states it services. \nMaking green energy affordable is central to our business strategy. Its technology enablement was a fairly complex program with multiple sub-programs running concurrently. TCS did an outstanding job in collaborating well with multiple stakeholders and managing risks very well.

We help build a future-\nready, digital core that enables quick, insights-driven decision making. We transform IT and business operating models using technology, making them more efficient, agile and responsive, freeing up resources to support innovation. Partnering with us enables our clients to try out a larger number of innovative ideas quickly, and launch new products, services and business models to drive growth and transformation.\nInnovate, Adapt, Thrive refers to how our scale, full services \ncapability and innovation offerings enable our clients to respond to short-term challenges while accelerating their pursuit of longer-term aspirations.\nKAK: We see interest in exploring use cases right across the \nenterprise. The most obvious areas are conversational systems, content creation and digital marketing, and activities which HV: People often relate innovations to serendipitous discoveries. \nWe help clients structure and scale the innovation process using \nthe TCS Agile Innovation Cloud (AIC). This framework brings together the best of TCS\u2019 talent, research and innovation inputs, global capabilities and ecosystem partnerships to scale up and speed up \u2018Ideas to Outcomes\u2019.\nFor an insurance major, we worked with the client\u2019s teams \nand collated actionable innovation ideas through a series of brainstorming workshops using the Clay Map. Leveraging our AIC, we rapidly built POCs every quarter, some of which got turned into MVPs and rolled out across the enterprise. In just eight months, dozens of innovation ideas were identified, and 24 progressed to become MVPs. \nOne reason for this high yield is that our teams leverage their \ncontextual knowledge, learned over years spent immersed in the client\u2019s IT and business landscape, to come up with ideas deeply rooted in that organization\u2019s reality and therefore more likely to succeed. How does TCS help clients innovate, adapt and thrive?\nGenerative AI is the talk of the season. What is the business \nopportunity around it? Innovation is about having a lightbulb moment. How do you \nscale that?KAK: Software that writes software has been around for a long time. In fact, this is the 50th anniversary of TCS\u2019 very first offshore development project, delivered using an in-house code generator. In the 80s, our TRDDC  was famous for its tools foundry, which could generate custom code translators on demand, converting source code from any programming language to any other language.\nTCS MasterCraft\u2122 is today used by hundreds of our clients \nfor developing, transforming and maintaining model-based applications. In fact, our award-winning product suite, TCS BaNCS\u2122, is written and maintained using MasterCraft. Even though there is effort involved in defining the model up-front, clients see significant productivity benefits. \nThe new low code, no code platforms have done away even \nwith those overheads. Their graphical drag and drop user interface empowers people with no coding knowledge to build sophisticated applications very quickly. \nAnd yet, none of this has led to any demand compression. It has \nonly led to more growth. We believe generative AI will be no different. Like prior breakthrough technologies, it will sharply bring down the effort per function point, driving up programmer productivity immensely. This will result in greater consumption, with volume growth more than making up for the effort deflation.If generative AI takes over coding, won\u2019t the IT services \nindustry become redundant?require processing of large amounts of unstructured data, text, \nimages and higher-level abstraction. \nLegal and procurement teams can use it to trawl through \ncontracts to identify specific clauses, or prepare a summary of variations of a particular clause.

Back in 2008, when the term SaaS was still new, we had built a subscription-based, single instance, multi-tenant core banking platform using TCS BaNCS for small banks in India. A similar model is powering start-up banks in Israel today. The insurance HV: The evidence is empirical. Every new generation of \ntechnology has led to reduction in programming effort per \nfunction point. But while that has steadily fallen, aggregate spending on IT services has only risen year after year, over decades.\nTake for example, the switch from assembly language to C. \nIts compilers came with large, extensible libraries of reusable pre-defined procedures. A developer could invoke a procedure with one line of code in C and embed its entire logic in the code base, without actually coding all of it from scratch. Three lines of C accomplished what took 30 lines in assembly language. The 10x effort deflation didn\u2019t result in mass layoffs of programmers. Instead, there was an explosion in software development because the same IT team could now build ten times as many function points. \nSimilarly, enterprises adopted offshore outsourcing, it led to a \nbig cost deflation, but nobody\u2019s IT budgets deflated. Instead, those savings went into building new systems and volumes rose to fill budgets and spending on IT services has only expanded. Likewise with low-code, no-code platforms.\nWhy is that so? Farm mechanization caused effort deflation and rendered the agricultural workforce redundant in the West.\nIndian IT companies are seen as fast followers on new technologies. Will that change with generative AI?What is the evidence for this thesis?\nKAK: With most goods and services, when the price falls, any \nincrease in volume is limited by how much of that good or service the market can consume in a defined period. When farm mechanization reduced the cost of tilling, the increased demand for men in tractors was not large enough to compensate for the effort deflation because there was only so much land available to till. \nDemand for IT services behaves differently. In every enterprise, \nthere is significant unmet demand. Every CIO has limited capacity for new system development, resulting in a requirement backlog that never gets fulfilled. Technologies like generative AI or low code-no code can help a CIO expand capacity and accomplish much more with the same budget. But even then, the backlog never goes away because there is no limit on business users\u2019 ingenuity or competitive drive. Demand just rises to fill the incremental capacity created by new technologies. \nHV: The emergence of new technologies triggers more ideas, \nexperimentation and more demand for our services.

In the last decade, we not only did that at scale on the entire class of digital technologies, but also invested in higher order capabilities so we could advise our clients on how best to harness the combinatorial power of new technologies in their specific business context. \nWe scaled up our Research and Innovation, exploring use cases \nacross different industries, creating solutions and showcasing them at our innovation centers. We expanded COIN, created new innovation frameworks and set up Pace Ports, our              co-innovation hubs, across the world.

Hosted on a public cloud, the solution is very resilient and can auto-scale. On the front-end, users can make a payment, or a request for payment, through a payment service called PayShap, formally launched in March 2023. Very conveniently, users don\u2019t need to enter the recipient\u2019s bank account or branch code details to make payments.

We incurred a 1.4% margin headwind in FY 2023 from backfilling and retention expenses. If we onboarded a lateral hire at a 20% premium during the year, that increase in employee cost is a recurring one. But yes, hopefuly we won\u2019t have any new headwind due to attrition in FY 2024. \nAlso, with the supplyside challenges easing, incremental \ncost of hiring laterals should be lower, and it also gives us an opportunity to bring down subcontractor expense. That is one important margin lever for FY 2024. Utilization improvement, flatter employee pyramid and hopefully, currency support, are the other levers. On the other hand, we will have our usual wage increase in Q1 and we should see further increases in travel expenses during the year.\nSS: It is not true that large outsourcing deals are necessarily \nmargin dilutive. A few high profile mega-deals in the industry \nwhose low quality revenues impacted margins have resulted in that perception. In the last five years, TCS has won several mega deals with TCV over $500 million, and every year we win dozens of large deals, with TCV over $50 million. And yet, during this period, our EBIT margin has remained in a tight band between 24 and 26 percent.\nProfitability of large deals depends on how you construct \nthem. A client might push for a certain amount of absolute cost reduction at the time of contract renewal. The service provider can either drop prices and sacrifice margins to deliver those You stood out in the industry with virtually zero attrition at senior levels. Now you had CEO-level attrition for the first time in your history. What does this say about your retention of senior talent?Is normalizing attrition a margin tailwind for FY 2024? What is your margin outlook for the year?\nYou won many large outsourcing deals in FY 2023, and your \nhighest ever number of large deals in Q4. Won\u2019t this hurt margins in FY 2024?\nQ&A with\nCFOSamir Seksaria Milind Lakkad\nCHRO\nQ&A   |  32", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3290, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94f9c5c5-e140-45c1-bc45-73290eff8215": {"__data__": {"id_": "94f9c5c5-e140-45c1-bc45-73290eff8215", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "469374cf-e97d-4dde-8332-fb27b7ee9c39", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "a99ef7425e91343eb9e491563b7e11d8dc977cc2631b0a57c9f6aab26dfab0e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a16aeec3-4542-4568-8996-a2cb179a9da8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "32", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "b0ef6fe5d950abc8789b0ede0b4f6ac8a83d9b92f8ab97a5ff4e5e1ad9979383", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4fb6d27f-68dd-4eb7-80dd-de39933e5a26", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a743e5733bec534ca9975cfee3000d9150116e530d956482456ff4dfb9b518d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ML: Yes, this is another unusual, industry-wide problem. \nThe pay disparities will eventually go away for two reasons. SS: In the short term, higher onsite wage inflation is a headwind \nbecause our legacy contracts have much lower cost of living adjustments written in. But in the medium and longer term, this will get adjusted. \nWage inflation affects everybody in the market including the \nclients themselves. Newer contracts reflect the changed cost structure for onsite effort. Also, contractual terms now peg annual cost of living increases to prevailing inflation rates.  That should help mitigate inflation risks in longer term contracts.\nSS: Inflation differential is not the only driver of currency \ndepreciation. Rupee is also affected by India\u2019s trade deficit, \ninterest rate differentials and capital movements. But for argument\u2019s sake, let us assume that we may not have the benefit of currency depreciation in the future. Now remember, the currency depreciation basically helps us offset wage inflation in India which historically, we never passed on to clients. In the changed circumstances, this too will get baked into new contracts the same way onsite wage inflation has been. So in the longer term, we should be able to sustain our current margins.\nML: In my view, the productivity benefits will get baked into \nclients\u2019 expectations around project velocity and throughput. For a given project team size, clients will expect much higher output at a much faster pace, compared to today. On aggregate, as the unit price of a function point falls, we expect volumes to increase. With ever-increasing dependence on technology for competitive differentiation, we expect enterprise spending to keep growing, for which we will have to keep hiring new talent. So the linearity between revenue and headcount is not going away any time soon.\nSS: Margins are a measure of relative competitiveness. Based \njust on the productivity improvements in code generation \nusing generative AI, it is difficult to see how a technology which is freely available to everyone \u2013 service providers as well as clients\u2019 IT teams \u2013 can change relative competitiveness and by extension, margins. Margin improvement is possible from selling higher-priced growth and transformation solutions which use generative AI. Likewise, new software products or platforms which use generative AI to deliver superior business outcomes. With laterals brought in at higher salaries, how do you manage the wage gaps between individuals of similar profile doing similar work?Will sticky onsite inflation be a structural headwind for your margins?\nWithout the inflation differential, the Rupee may show greater \nstrength than in the past. How will your margins sustain then?\nFinally, a question on generative AI. Will the productivity gains \ndelink revenue growth from headcount addition in the future? Can we expect a higher margin as a consequence?  ML: Work from home is definitely more convenient for everybody, but there were drawbacks. Tenured employees who are well networked within the organization can work effectively and even collaborate virtually using the social capital built up over the years. That isn\u2019t the case with more junior employees. Workplace essentials like collaboration, mentorship and team-building suffered a lot in these two years. \nThen there is the matter of organizational culture. Over half our \nworkforce today was hired after March 2020. New employees get acculturated through physical interactions with senior colleagues and leaders, by observing and following their behaviors and ways of thinking. Without those interactions, employee engagement as well as acculturation got badly impacted. All these factors led us to gradually bring back people to our offices during the year.Why is Return to Office so important to TCS? Why not let \nemployees continue to work from home?ML: Historically, women\u2019s attrition at TCS has been similar or \nlower than men\u2019s attrition, so this is unusual. There might be other reasons but intuitively, I would think working from home during the pandemic reset the domestic arrangements for some women, keeping them from returning to office even after everything normalized. \nThe higher attrition among women in FY 2023 is a setback to our \nefforts to promote gender diversity but we are doubling down on it. Focused leadership development programs like iExcel are driving tremendous change. Of all the leadership positions fulfilled with internal candidates in FY 2023, women made up 23% of the selected candidates, even though they account for only 14% of the applicant pool. This speaks well of the quality of the women candidates in our leadership pool as well as the supportive attitudes of our business leaders in promoting diversity. Likewise, in our external hiring, women make up 38.1% \nof our net hires this year, versus 35.7% in our workforce. Attrition among women is higher than for men.

This affects crop yields, farmer incomes and food security.  \nTo help address these challenges, TCS built a digital platform \nto empower the Indian farmer and improve the resilience of the nation\u2019s farming sector. The TCS Digital Platform for Next Generation Agriculture (DNA) is a state-of-the-art, cloud-based decision intelligence and crop monitoring system that provides customized, site-specific predictive advisory services to farmers and other players in the food value chain.\nTCS DNA uses an innovative `Sky-Earth\u2019 convergence, intelligently \nfusing remote-sensing data from earth observation satellites and drones with data from proximal sensors and handheld devices on the field. This gives scale and reduces cost significantly without sacrificing accuracy. Proprietary AI/ML algorithms are utilized to analyze the data and provide reliable information and predictive intelligence on weather, soil condition, crop health, and pest forecasts. Farmers can use these insights to make quicker and more informed decisions, optimize production costs and improve their yield. Rallis India Ltd, a leading agri-input company, partnered with TCS for the first field deployment of the new platform, to improve the productivity of its hybrid seed production farms, as well as for internal business planning. Branded Drishti (\u201cVision\u201d), the platform is used to monitor approximately 130 million hectares of agricultural land across India, for various aspects such as crop productivity, soil moisture, early alerts for pest outbreak, as well as seasonal weather anomalies and extreme weather events. The platform has helped Rallis increase the field scouting efficiency of its hybrid seed production team, and improved yield by 1 to 2%.\nTCS DNA is also helping Amalgamation Plantations, the second \nlargest producer of tea in India, improve the quality and sustainability of tea leaves procured from small tea growers. It is being used to remotely monitor various aspects of small plantations using satellite imagery, predict pest and disease and improve quality. This is expected to help small tea growers improve their income by 15% and reduce rejections by 20%.\nOur partnership with TCS is helping us alleviate the issues of farmers and agriculture. The Drishti platform identifies problem areas and offers actionable insights to farmers in India, leading to effective crop management by reducing the risks and minimizing the loss in yield.\nSanjiv

Central banks raised interest rates sharply in response. As a result, the global GDP is estimated to have grown at a more subdued 3.4% in 2022, versus 5.9% in the prior year\n1. \nGlobal technology spending on Enterprise software and IT services crossed the $2 trillion\n2 mark in 2022, growing 5.5% YoY . \nIT services grew 3.5% YoY , to $1,250 billion. This growth was led by accelerated cloud adoption, preference for external expertise due to severe talent scarcity, and expanding scope of digital transformation to cover more back-office operational areas.\nThe global IT services industry continues to be a highly \nfragmented one, with even the largest provider having a mid-single digit market share. TCS is among the largest IT services providers globally, with a market share of 2.2%, and has outperformed the market, growing significantly higher than market growth over the last decade.

An expanding share of this business is helping drive a steady increase in the scope and scale of services consumed year after year, and an expansion of TCS\u2019 share of wallet, as evidenced by the client metrics.\nOver time, this strategy has resulted in deep and enduring \ncustomer relationships, a vibrant and engaged workforce, industry-leading profitability, a steady expansion of the addressable market, and a proven track record in delivering longer term stakeholder value.\nEnabling Investments\nTCS pioneered\n4 the use of the word \u2018digital\u2019 to describe the \nnew family of technologies that emerged in the last decade. Quick to recognize the potential of cloud, the company made investments ahead of time in launching new platform-based business models as far back as in 2009\n5, reskilling the workforce, \nresearch and innovation, building collaborative workspaces and innovation centers, intellectual property, and alliances and partnerships. Those early investments have given TCS a head start in participating in its customers\u2019 G&T journeys.\nThe company continues to invest in co-innovation hubs, \nlaunching TCS Pace Ports\u2122 in major markets. TCS teams use these physical spaces to work with academic and start-up partners, ideate jointly with client teams and rapidly build prototypes. The Pace Ports at Pittsburgh in the US, in the Carnegie Mellon University campus, and the other in Toronto, Canada, were formally inaugurated this year. Including the ones in Tokyo, New York and Amsterdam, the company has five Pace Ports in all.\nThe company launched joint innovation hubs as well, using \nthe TCS Pace\u2122 framework. TCS and Boots launched an agile incubator called INNOVATE Powered by TCS Pace\u2122, at Boots\u2019 Nottingham headquarters in the UK. TCS forged a major applied engineering and research partnership with The National Robotarium, UK\u2019s largest and most advanced AI and robotics research centre, located at Heriot-Watt University\u2019s Edinburgh campus.\nTCS continued to expand and deepen its industry-leading \nportfolio of products and platforms, launching new variants within the ignio\u2122 suite and building newer functionality and features in the TCS BaNCS\u2122 suite, HOBS, TwinX, Mastercraft and Jile. TCS Omnistore\u2122 now offers three more modules as part of its AI powered enterprise personalization - Unified and composable commerce, Enterprise personalization, and Marketing hub.\n TCS\u2019 dedicated practice units around AWS, Microsoft Azure \nand Google Cloud Platform have been steadily investing in training, certifications, credentials and in building solutions and intellectual property on their respective hyperscaler stacks. In FY 2023, the company crossed the milestone of 100,000 hyperscaler-certified employees. By virtue of being one of their largest system integrator partners with deep domain expertise across multiple areas, TCS was the launch partner for many new solutions introduced by hyperscaler platforms during the year.\nThe company has leveraged its deep domain knowledge across \nmultiple industries to create an extensive catalog of over 100 industry cloud offerings addressing the needs of clients across 20 industries.

In major economies, the heightened risk of a recession \u2013 made worse by a banking crisis \u2013 has led to uncertainty in enterprise decision-making, affecting spending on capex and certain discretionary programs.\nDespite this, spending on IT services has been resilient so far. \nCloud migration programs are continuing apace, and clients continue to launch new G&T projects. The higher level of uncertainty in the business environment has made clients more receptive to proactive proposals around IT and business operating model transformations that can not only deliver significant efficiencies but also help them become more agile and resilient. All this has resulted in a strong order book for FY\n \n2023, at $34.1 Bn, which is 1.2 times revenue. The pipeline \nhas also grown well.\nThis provides visibility on medium-term growth amid near-\nterm uncertainty. If the delayed decision-making and cash conservation seen in some segments at the end of FY 2023 flows over into the first half of FY 2024, that could result in some moderation in full year revenue growth after two years of strong growth.\nKey demand drivers expected to power the company\u2019s growth in \nFY 2024 include:\n\u2022\n T\nechnology transformation: IT infrastructure \nmodernization, cloud enablement, application and data \nestate modernization, cloud migration, data centre and collocated data support, digital workplace, digital twins, cyber security, ERP modernization, low-code no-code, 5G/Edge and AI adoption.\n8  IMF World Economic Outlook Update, April 2023", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3181, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e62c92e6-d241-4b89-90a4-88d706991024": {"__data__": {"id_": "e62c92e6-d241-4b89-90a4-88d706991024", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "85ef8307-1aa7-4910-b14d-21f2d783237c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "776f61b1dc1701b4127dc47cf605572efe12084182156f9217838eb6ea042d1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ad12fe30-d19d-4cf9-b433-5653fc07dc7d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "94", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "495aaafff0471f642a58dd344724251fa174f8e83d1e9884e7d40193bf2e2a1e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d0d565a1-b07e-4b31-996d-b3d18c80ed26", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e3bfa6f67aaa48155a8c5ceff4d76aea88675f95d1f1cbffda89215b4f23bd1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Management Discussion and Analysis    |  95\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23\u2022 G&T : Customer experience transformation using \npersonalization, omnichannel implementation, immersive \nexperiences using XR/Metaverse, product and business model innovation, supply chain modernization, M&A integration / divestitures, sustainability.\n\u2022\n Oper\nations: Traditional outsourcing, vendor consolidation \nand multi-services deals, AI/ML-led transformation of IT / business operations for greater resilience and leaner operating models, managed services models and real time operation visibility.\nEnterprise Risk Management\n9\nFY 2023 saw multiple external and internal challenges continuing \nto shape the overall risk profile of the company. Macroeconomic and geo-political risks had an impact throughout the year. The Russia-Ukraine war and geo-political tensions, trade wars and imposed sanctions were pervasive and had direct and cascading impacts on economies and businesses. Shortages, rising inflation, supply-chain disruptions, energy crisis led to further uncertainties in the economic growth environment, with the year ending with banking industry upheavals in US and Europe. During the year, IT organizations including TCS faced the knock-on effects of the pandemic including attrition and impact of hybrid modes of working. Technological advancements and breakthroughs like generative AI and metaverse have opened up new vistas of both risks and opportunities.\nTCS continues to monitor this uncertain and dynamic business \nenvironment very closely and has strengthened the deployment of its Enterprise Risk Management framework to address the risks and leverage the associated opportunities. This framework enables risk identification, risk assessment, risk response planning and actions, risk monitoring and overall risk governance. Key risk indicators and control indicators are used to anticipate risks and assess effectiveness of their mitigation actions respectively.\nTCS takes a holistic view of its enterprise risk profile, covering \nstrategic, operational, compliance, financial and catastrophic risks, thus enabling informed decision-making. Risks are assessed and managed at various levels with a top-down and bottom-up approach across the enterprise, business units, geographies, business functions, customer relationships and individual projects.\nListed below are some of the key risks, anticipated impact on the company and mitigation strategies.\nKey Risks (R) \n/ Opportunity (O)Impact on the Company In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate\n10Financial \nimplications \nof the risk or \nopportunity11\nVolatile global political and economic environment (R)\u2022\n   Geo -politics and macroeconomic \nvolatility can affect demand for the \ncompany\u2019s services. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has led to supply chain disruptions, energy crisis, food and merchandise scarcities and related inflation. \n\u2022\n  P\nersistent high inflation in major \neconomies could affect consumer spending and fuel social unrest. Repeated interest rate hikes by central banks to rein in the inflation could result in economic slowdowns. \n\u2022\n  Con\ntinuing turmoil in the banking \nsector could affect not only spending in that sector, but also squeeze liquidity.\n\u2022\n  All of these c\nould affect clients\u2019 \nbusiness outlook and result in reduced demand for TCS\u2019 services. It could also increase TCS\u2019 costs of doing business. \n\u2022\n  In a\nddition, there could be risks to \nservice delivery, business continuity, cybersecurity, sanctions compliance and human rights risks in geo-politically sensitive zones, all of which could increase costs or affect the company\u2019s revenue growth. \u2022\n  Br oad-based business mix, well diversified across \ngeographies and industry verticals.\n\u2022\n Monit\nor changing geopolitical scenarios, the \npotential business implications and strengthen \ninternal controls to further safeguard against secondary risks.\n\u2022\n Off\nerings and value propositions targeting all \nstakeholders (in addition to the CIO) in the customer organization, covering discretionary as well as non-discretionary spends, and relevant at every point in the business cycle.\n\u2022\n P\narticipate in the customer\u2019s G&T initiatives \nthrough services and offerings including advisory services, migration and modernization of applications and workplace transformation using location independent agile, deep contextual knowledge and data-driven analytics and dashboards.\n\u2022\n Wher\ne customer\u2019s discretionary budgets are \nuncertain, focus on cost and optimization propositions in the short term to improve their business efficiency.Negative\n9 TCFD Risk Management A, B and C  \n10 GRI 3-3  \n11 GRI 201-2, TCFD Risk Management A, B and C", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4683, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d0d565a1-b07e-4b31-996d-b3d18c80ed26": {"__data__": {"id_": "d0d565a1-b07e-4b31-996d-b3d18c80ed26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fd936ff5-66bb-43b6-bda2-c8177bd0124e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "a21bfd6bcfdfe47d6f11fb2df73517434819b5d42b9f7ba5c9a6777b6abaf5af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e62c92e6-d241-4b89-90a4-88d706991024", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "e8a7eb89d9f41d212abde1ce7a00259904f5fbd37054f12f213699f4587f3eed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "89379d8e-ca03-4249-892e-72a905aea96d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8df29e387976a554f8acfcd47aacd480ae3ba3ab85f1b8bb91eb8c2e9f5ab8af", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Management Discussion and Analysis    |  96\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Key Risks (R) \n/ Opportunity (O)Impact on the Company In case of risk, approach to adapt or mitigate\n10Financial \nimplications \nof the risk or \nopportunity11\n\u2022  P roactively invest in infrastructure and \nresourcing to satisfy anticipated customer demand for flexible products and platforms-based solution offerings and subscription-based services to gain market share and new clients and markets.\n\u2022\n En\nter into more long-term contracts. \n\u2022\n T\narget market segments which provide counter-\ncyclical support in times of downturn.\n\u2022\n Le\nverage business ecosystem through \ncollaboration with partners, start-ups and alliances to participate in transformation initiatives of customers. \n\u2022\n Coun\ntry-level business continuity plans in place \nto address potential conflicts in the region.\nTalent risk due to huge demand for talent globally and attrition  \n(R & O)\u2022\n  The c\nompany\u2019s ability to attract, \ndevelop, motivate, and retain talent is critical to its business success. \n\u2022\n  T\nalent scarcity can lead to poaching of \nthe company\u2019s employees and result in higher attrition.

The Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework (the 2013 framework) is intended to increase transparency and accountability in an organization\u2019s process of designing and implementing a system of internal control. The framework requires a company to identify and analyze risks and manage appropriate responses. The company has successfully laid down the framework and ensured its effectiveness.\nTCS\u2019 internal controls are commensurate with its size and the \nnature of its operations. These have been designed to provide reasonable assurance with regard to recording and providing reliable financial and operational information, complying with applicable statutes, safeguarding assets from unauthorized use, executing transactions with proper authorization and ensuring compliance with corporate policies. TCS has a well-defined delegation of power with authority limits for approving contracts as well as expenditure. Processes for formulating and reviewing annual and long-term business plans have been laid down. TCS uses a state-of-the-art enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that connects all parts of the organization, to record data for accounting, consolidation and management information purposes. It has continued its efforts to align all its processes and controls with global best practices.\nTCS management assessed the effectiveness of the company\u2019s \ninternal control over financial reporting (as defined in Regulation 17 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015  (SEBI LODR) as of March 31, 2023.B S R & Co. LLP , the statutory auditors of TCS have audited the financial statements included in this annual report and have issued an attestation report on the company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in section 143 of Companies Act, 2013).\nTCS has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers Services LLP (PwC)\nLLP to oversee and carry out internal audit of its activities. The audit is based on an internal audit plan, which is reviewed each year in consultation with the statutory auditors and approved by the Audit Committee. In line with international practice, the conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the review of internal controls and risks in the company\u2019s operations such as software delivery, accounting and finance, procurement, employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes, including the subsidiaries and foreign branches.\nTCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialized third party \nconsultants and professionals for business specific compliances such as quality management, service management, information security, etc. The Audit Committee reviews reports submitted by the management and audit reports submitted by internal auditors and statutory auditors. Suggestions for improvement are considered and the audit committee follows up on corrective action. The audit committee also meets TCS\u2019 statutory auditors to ascertain, inter alia, their views on the adequacy of internal control systems and keeps the board of directors informed of its major observations periodically.\nBased on its evaluation (as defined in section 177 of Companies \nAct 2013 and Regulation 18 of SEBI LODR), TCS\u2019 Audit Committee has concluded that, as of March 31, 2023, the company\u2019s internal financial controls were adequate and operating effectively.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3711, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}",

"Corporate\rGovernance\rReport\r \r\r|\r\r113\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23I. Compan y\u2019s Philosophy on Corporate Governance\n \n E\nffective corporate governance practices constitute \nthe strong foundation on which successful commercial \nenterprises are built to last. The Company\u2019s philosophy on corporate governance oversees business strategies and ensures fiscal accountability, ethical corporate behaviour and fairness to all stakeholders comprising employees, investors, customers, regulators, suppliers and the society at large. Strong leadership and effective corporate governance practices have been the Company\u2019s hallmark inherited from the Tata culture and ethos.\n \n The Compan\ny follows the Tata Group philosophy of building \nsustainable businesses that are rooted in the community and demonstrate care for the environment. Being a part of the Tata Group, which epitomizes sustainability, the Company has inherited a strong legacy of fair and transparent ethical governance, as embodied in the Tata Code of Conduct (TCoC).\n \n The Compan\ny has adopted a Code of Conduct for its \nemployees including the Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director and the Executive Directors. In addition, the Company has adopted a Code of Conduct for its non-executive directors which includes Code of Conduct for Independent Directors that suitably incorporates the duties of independent directors as laid down in the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Act\u201d).\n \n The Compan\ny\u2019s corporate governance philosophy has been \nfurther strengthened through the Tata Business Excellence Model, the TCS Code of Conduct for Prevention of Insider Trading and the Code of Corporate Disclosure Practices (\u201cInsider Trading Code\u201d). The Company has in place an Information Security Policy that ensures proper utilization of IT resources.\n \n The Compan\ny is in compliance with the requirements \nstipulated under Regulations 17 to 27 read with Schedule V and clauses (b) to (i) and (t) of sub-regulation (2) of Regulation 46 of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (\u201cSEBI Listing Regulations\u201d), as applicable, with regard to corporate governance.\n \n The de\ntails of TCS\u2019 board structure and the various \ncommittees that constitute the governance structure1 of \nthe organization are covered in detail in this report.\n \n The v\narious material aspects of corporate governance and TCS\u2019 approach to them are discussed in the table below:\nMaterial Topic TCS\u2019 Approach\nBoard effectiveness, independence and protection of minority shareholders\u2019 interestsBoard effectiveness is enhanced by setting a high bar in selecting the right mix of individuals to serve on the Board, with the right qualifications, expertise and experience, who can collectively serve the best interests of all stakeholders, maintain board and management accountability and drive corporate ethics, values and sustainability. Profiles of Board of Directors are available at https://www.tcs.com/ir-corporate-governance.\nFor greater diversity of opinions and perspectives within the Board, the Nomination and Remuneration Committee\n2 has fostered diversity in terms of backgrounds, areas of expertise \nand:\n\u2022 \n Gender: T\nwo (22.2 per cent) of the nine Directors are women.\n\u2022 \n Na\ntionality: Three nationalities represented \u2013 Indian, American and Danish.\n\u2022 \n Indus\ntry: Technology, Banking, Energy, Transportation and Academia.Corporate\nGovernanceReport\nAbout TCS | 3\n1 GRI 2-9\n2 GRI 2-10", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3479, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "026181f9-5c12-4779-ac1b-19d2ad7c0707": {"__data__": {"id_": "026181f9-5c12-4779-ac1b-19d2ad7c0707", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "083a0596-01f5-4a89-a6ec-6fabf3906823", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "114", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "072dd594041f4ab6a28976ebdf9e85d46ef4e51d1290114b7508910961e405c5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1b32fe9f-5ad2-4bbf-ad8f-f62cf270d9ca", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "113", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "e4ffaf20e94ee444fe116494abfa516f0ac50ecd2cad3554fb593838142922d4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "242a816d-d862-4142-b41e-0493b535afe0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b86dc46c580ea2dae9ef859928f00c892ef9c0740c24ce424fde6f8fa8bdc42f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Corporate\rGovernance\rReport\r \r\r|\r\r114\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Material Topic TCS\u2019 Approach\nTCS\u2019 policy on Appointment of Directors and Board Diversity can be found at  \nhttps://on.tcs.com/appointment-BoD .\nBoard independence is ensured by having an independent majority, with 5 independent directors out of 9 i.e., 55.6 percent. None of the independent directors is related to each other, or to the non-independent directors. Average tenure of independent directors is 6 years.\nBoard effectiveness is further improved by ensuring that none of the directors holds \ndirectorships in more than seven listed entities, and none of the executive directors serves as an independent director on the Boards of more than three listed entities.\nTCS\u2019 governance philosophy around minority shareholders\u2019 interests is guided by the TCoC \nwhich emphasizes fairness and transparency to all stakeholders. Further a qualified, diverse and independent Board ensures that minority shareholders\u2019 interests are protected.\nTCS strives to reduce information asymmetry through transparency, extensive disclosures \nand detailed commentary of the demand environment and the state of the business, and material developments. The Company provides a variety of channels including a structured global investor outreach program, through which minority shareholders can interact with the management or the Board.\nShareholders can communicate concerns and grievances to the Company Secretary\u2019s office \nthrough a well-publicized channel, where complaints are tracked till closure. The Stakeholders\u2019 Relationship Committee oversees the redressal of these complaints.\nAvoidance of conflict of interest\n3Chairmanship4 of the Board is a non-executive position, and separate from that of the Chief \nExecutive Officer and Managing Director (CEO and MD).\nTCoC5 for non-executive directors, and for independent directors, carries explicit clauses \ncovering avoidance of conflict of interest. Likewise, it explicitly prohibits any  \nemployee \u2013 including the executive directors \u2013 from accepting any position of responsibility, with or without remuneration, with any other organization without TCS\u2019 prior written approval. For the executive directors, such approval must be obtained from the Board.\nValues, Ethics and compliance\n6Over the last five decades, TCS has consistently demonstrated very principled conduct and has earned its reputation for trust and integrity while building a highly successful global business. The Company\u2019s core values are: Leading Change, Integrity, Respect for the Individual, Excellence, and Learning and Sharing.\nThe TCoC serves as a moral guide and a governing framework for responsible corporate \ncitizenship. It sets out guidelines on various topics including respect for human rights, prohibition of bribery and corruption, recognition of employees\u2019 freedom of association, and avoidance of conflicts of interest.\nEvery employee of the Company is required to sign the TCoC at the time of joining. Web-based \nannual refresher courses are mandated to ensure continued awareness of the Code. Further, frequent communications from the leadership, reiterate the importance of the company values and the TCoC.\nCustomers are made aware of the TCoC principles in contract discussions, and through \ninclusion of specific clauses in proposals and contracts.\nEmployees also undergo Web-based mandatory training every year on Anti-bribery and ethical \nbehaviour.

Changes to legislation are closely monitored, risks are evaluated and effectively managed across the business operations.\nGovernance, Risk and Compliance are overseen by the Chief Compliance Officer,  \nChief Risk Officer and the Chief HR Officer who report to the Chief Operating Officer and Executive Director (COO and ED), and CEO and MD respectively. At the apex level, the Audit Committee headed by an Independent Director oversees compliance to the TCoC, Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Policy, Gift and Hospitality Policy and also to the external regulations. \nTax Strategy\n7TCS is committed to comply with the applicable laws and regulations, and believes in reporting to the respective tax authorities, relevant information that is complete and accurate, in a timely manner.\nTCS does not engage in aggressive and contrived tax planning or tax structuring for the purpose \nof gaining tax advantages. TCS\u2019s tax policy is to optimize the tax cost, avail tax incentives where available, while achieving 100 per cent compliance with the spirit as well as the letter of the tax laws and regulations in all countries in which it operates. Compliance is achieved through a robust compliance reporting and monitoring process, with a strong governance on minimizing the tax risk. TCS has zero tolerance towards tax evasion, or the facilitation of tax evasion, by itself or by its employees or vendors.\nTCS maintains open and collaborative relationships with governments and tax authorities \nworldwide. Where appropriate, TCS seeks advance clearance from tax authorities on the proposed tax treatment of transactions, helping pre-empt future disputes.\nBoard Oversight of Sustainability Matters\n8TCS\u2019 approach to sustainable growth is built on the belief that it can expand its business by creating longer term value for all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, suppliers and local communities, while also valuing the environment. The various sustainability topics material to TCS are overseen by the relevant Board committees, as outlined below:\nMaterial Sustainability Topics Board Committee\nFinancial reporting, robustness of internal controls and risk management systems, auditor remuneration, compliance to policies around insider trading, whistle blower, ethics and TCoC.Audit Committee\nRisk management policy and plan, management of foreign exchange risks, cyber security risks, data privacy risks and intellectual property infringement risks.Risk Management Committee\nRecommend composition of Board and its committees, appointment/re-appointment of directors and KMP , design executive directors\u2019 remuneration, recommend remuneration policy for directors, executive team and KMP , evaluation of the performance of the Board, Committees and Directors.Nomination and Remuneration Committee\nHealth and safety at the workplace, shareholder grievances and other sustainability initiatives.Stakeholders\u2019 Relationship Committee\nCommunity initiatives and Corporate Social Responsibility, including compliances.Corporate Social Responsibility Committee\nSuccession planning TCS\u2019 philosophy of empowering employees, its industry-leading talent retention, and an organization structure that devolves executive decision-making across the three business groups (viz., Relationship Incubation group, Enterprise Growth group and Business Transformation group) have resulted in a large and deep bench of leadership talent that enables robust succession planning and continuity and consistency in strategy. Succession planning for the top two leadership positions in each business unit is reviewed by senior management. Additionally, heads of business units carry out succession planning for key functions within their units.\nSuccession planning at senior management levels is reviewed by the Board. Business or unit \nheads are invited to present on specific topics at Board meetings from time to time, offering an opportunity to the directors to assess their values, competencies, and capabilities.\n7 GRI 207-1, GRI 207-2, GRI 207-3.

Women account for 65% of the illiterate population, and the rest is from marginalized communities. To address the causes of non-literacy, TCS devised the Literacy as a Service Program (LaaS) which augments the Government of India\u2019s e\ufb00orts to improve literacy. LaaS provides an innovative teaching method by combining the power of IT with the theory of cognition and laws of perception. LaaS adopts creative means of delivery to enable functional literacy, such as animated graphic patterns for easy visual and auditory learning.\nModules on the platform include functional literacy (8-10 \nhours), digital literacy (5-7 hours), and awareness on key citizen entitlements (3-4 hours), available in 12 languages \u2013 nine Indian, and three foreign.\nThus far, LaaS has successfully paved the way to self-reliance \nfor over 1.13 million learners (~60% women) and more than 200,000 Preraks through literacy.\nIn August 2022, TCS launched the \u2018Each one Empowers one\u2019 \nportal which allows employees of TCS and Tata Group, along with their families, to empower non-literates in their local community, such as security guards, domestic workers and gardeners.\nThe program has generated transforming impact by promoting \nsocial inclusion, \ufb01nancial stability and economic growth. It has also propelled neo-literates to receive better access to government bene\ufb01t programs, \ufb01nancial systems and empowered them to have a more signi\ufb01cant say in family and community decision-making.\nLaaS Case Study\nPyari Ben resides in the Bijori hamlet of Puwasa village, in Madhya Pradesh\u2019s Alirajpur district, one of the least literate and poorest districts in the country. Due to limited local employment prospects, villagers from Alirajpur travel for work to nearby Gujarat cities; Pyari is not an exception in this regard. She never had the opportunity to attend school, so she never achieved literacy.

She also lacked clarity on career goals or available job prospects.\nTCS Youth Employability Program brought a ray of sunshine \nto her gloomy worldview. During the Covid years, Preeti not only learned math and reasoning skills, she also worked on her overall personality. She learnt from her trainer, the importance of public speaking, projecting con\ufb01dence in online interviews, and active listening. In the TCS NQT exam later that year, she scored 77.39% and got placed in December \u201921.\nShe launched a website and her \ufb01rst YouTube channel \n\u201cCommerce Stocking\u201d about stock market investment tips. In December\u201922, she quit her job and became an entrepreneur, launching her dream website for educating people on the \ufb01nancial sector.

"Corporate Social Responsibility  |  142\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23Volunteering for Youth Employment \nProgram (YEP)Rahul Pathak\u2019s journey of volunteering started six years back, with him travelling to Osmanabad around 280 kms from Pune over weekends to teach the students of Terna College of Engineering. \nRahul did face challenges initially teaching in virtual mode, \nbut he overcame it by using e\ufb00ective online teaching skills like polling, breakout rooms etc. He felt because of the virtual mode now he can contribute to engineering colleges outside Maharashtra. In his sessions, Rahul always gives practical examples which the students can relate to, and understand better. He also helps these youth in developing con\ufb01dence so that they can succeed in all aspects of their lives.\nRahul quotes \u201cI felt quite proud as a teacher when my students \nsecured their dream jobs. My life suddenly seemed to have a meaning and purpose. Giving is the greatest feeling in the world, and seeing my students achieve their goals and \ufb02ourish in their jobs brings me enormous joy. Continue to contribute to this worthy cause; these youngsters desperately need mentoring from TCS YEP Faculties. \u201d\nTCS Volunteers Deploy with Red Cross, NAIn Oct\u201922, \ufb01ve TCSers deployed to Florida with the Red Cross to volunteer in areas impacted by Hurricane Ian, the deadliest hurricane to have hit Florida in decades. Their reasons were di\n\ufb00er\nent and re \ufb02\nected their life experiences. Some signed on \nto a 9-day deployment to give back to the community the help they had received during a natural disaster. Others had served previously with the military or a service organization and wanted to use that experience to help.\nDuring their deployment, Aria Rahimi, Lewis Hunt, Charu Mehndiratta, Patty Sanchez, and Niki Shah packed food supplies and distributed them to a\ufb00ected communities on Pine Island and other areas in Lee County. They assisted in identifying and addressing local needs with respect to shelter, food, health and spiritual services.\nBusiness with PurposeBusiness with Purpose is a distinctive framework that enables \u2018Purpose Partnerships\u2019 with like-minded organizations to advance access, equity and inclusion around the world.

TCS\u2019 leadership and employees provide pro bono technology services to such organizations to generate sustainable impact. TCS works closely with key stakeholders to understand their requirements and build the right software tools that help them establish a digital presence, raise funds more easily, build transparency in their operations and work more e\n\ufb03\nciently.\nThis helps those organizations extend their support to more local and global bene\ufb01ciaries, demonstrating the force multiplier e\n\ufb00ect tha\nt technology can play.

Until FY 2022, TCS used the DEFRA 2012, spend based emission factors, which are outdated. In view of adopting updated emission factors, there was a reduction in category 1 by 89% and category 2 by 82%. \n\u2022\n  Ca\ntegory 3: The well to tank (WTT) emissions from the fuel used in stationary and mobile combustion such as diesel in DG sets and owned \nvehicles, LPG or PNG in cafeteria, natural gas for space heating/ cooling, fuel used in hired vehicles (cabs/ buses) are included in this category in FY 2023. Earlier in FY 2022, only WTT of electricity procured was considered. The increase in scope of reporting contributes to 3.5% of the total emissions under category 3.\n\u2022\n  Ca\ntegory 4: Until FY 2022, TCS had included only emissions from transportation of IT assets considering its relative significance compared to \nother supplies. In FY 2023, TCS has also included emissions related to non-IT supplies and waste disposal.

The Group offers a \nconsulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of \nIT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is \ndelivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile \ndelivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in \nsoftware development.\n The Compan\ny is a public limited company incorporated and \ndomiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS \nHouse, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at March \n31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company \nowned 72.27% of the Company\u2019s equity share capital.\n The Boar\nd of Directors approved the consolidated financial \nstatements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and \nauthorised for issue on April 12, 2023.\n2)\n St\natement of compliance\n These c\nonsolidated financial statements have been \nprepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting \nStandard (referred to as \u201cInd AS\u201d) prescribed under  \nsection 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the \nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as \namended from time to time.\n3)\n Basis of pr\neparation\n These c\nonsolidated financial statements have been \nprepared on historical cost basis except for certain financial \ninstruments and defined benefit plans which are measured \nat fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting \nperiod. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of \nthe consideration given in exchange for goods and services. \nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an \nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \nbetween market participants at the measurement date. All \nassets and liabilities have been classified as current and \nnon-current as per the Group\u2019s normal operating cycle. \nBased on the nature of services rendered to customers \nand time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the \nconsideration for such services rendered, the Group has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.\n The s\ntatement of cash flows has been prepared under \nindirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the \neffects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals \nor accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or \npayments and items of income or expense associated \nwith investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows \nfrom operating, investing and financing activities of the \nGroup are segregated. The Group considers all highly liquid \ninvestments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in \nvalue to be cash equivalents.\n The functional curr\nency of the Company and its Indian \nsubsidiaries is the Indian Rupee ( `). The functional currency \nof foreign subsidiaries is the currency of the primary \neconomic environment in which the entity operates. \nForeign currency transactions are recorded at exchange \nrates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign \ncurrency denominated monetary assets and liabilities \nare retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the \nbalance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising \non settlement and restatement are recognised in the \nstatement of profit and loss.

Revisions to accounting estimates are \nrecognised in the period in which the estimates are revised \nand future periods are affected.\n The Gr\noup uses the following critical accounting estimates \nin preparation of its consolidated financial statements:\n (a)\n R\nevenue recognition\n \n R\nevenue for fixed-price contracts is recognised using \npercentage-of-completion method. The Group uses \njudgement to estimate the future cost-to-completion \nof the contracts which is used to determine degree of completion of the performance obligation.\n (b)\n Use\nful lives of property, plant and equipment\n \n The Gr\noup reviews the useful life of property, \nplant and equipment at the end of each reporting period. This reassessment may result in change in \ndepreciation expense in future periods.\n (c)\n Impairmen\nt of goodwill\n \n The Gr\noup estimates the value-in-use of the cash \ngenerating units (CGUs) based on the future cash \nflows after considering current economic conditions \nand trends, estimated future operating results and \ngrowth rate and anticipated future economic and \nregulatory conditions. The estimated cash flows are \ndeveloped using internal forecasts. The discount rates \nused for the CGUs represent the weighted average \ncost of capital based on the historical market returns of comparable companies.\n (d)\n F\nair value measurement of financial instruments\n \n When the f\nair value of financial assets and financial \nliabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be \nmeasured based on quoted prices in active markets, \ntheir fair value is measured using valuation techniques \nincluding the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs \nto these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a \ndegree of judgement is required in establishing fair \nvalues. Judgements include considerations of inputs \nsuch as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes \nin assumptions about these factors could affect the \nreported fair value of financial instruments.\n (e)\n Pr\novision for income tax and deferred tax assets\n \n The Gr\noup uses estimates and judgements based \non the relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of \nrevenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is \nexercised while determining the provision for income \ntax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be \navailable against which the deductible temporary \ndifferences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, \nthe Group exercises its judgement to reassess the \ncarrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of \neach reporting period.\n (f\n)\n Pr\novisions and contingent liabilities\n \n The Gr\noup estimates the provisions that have present \nobligations as a result of past events and it is probable \nthat outflow of resources will be required to settle the \nobligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect \nthe current best estimates.\n \n The Gr\noup uses significant judgements to assess \ncontingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are \nrecognised when there is a possible obligation arising \nfrom past events, the existence of which will be \nconfirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly \nwithin the control of the Group or a present obligation \nthat arises from past events where it is either not \nprobable that an outflow of resources will be required \nto settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the \namount cannot be made.

Accounting policy information, \ntogether with other information, is material when it can \nreasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary \nusers of general purpose financial statements. The Group \ndoes not expect this amendment to have any significant \nimpact in its financial statements.\n Ind AS 12 \u2013 Inc\nome Taxes\n The amendmen\nts clarify how companies account \nfor deferred tax on transactions such as leases and \ndecommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed \nthe scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 \nand 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no \nlonger applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, \ngive rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary \ndifferences. The Group is evaluating the impact, if any, in its financial statements.\n \n Ind AS 8 \u2013 Acc\nounting Policies, Changes in Accounting \nEstimates and Errors\n The amendmen\nts will help entities to distinguish between \naccounting policies and accounting estimates. The \ndefinition of a change in accounting estimates has been \nreplaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under \nthe new definition, accounting estimates are \u201cmonetary \namounts in financial statements that are subject to \nmeasurement uncertainty\u201d. Entities develop accounting \nestimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves \nmeasurement uncertainty. The Group does not expect this \namendment to have any significant impact in its financial \nstatements.\n7)\n Busi\nness combinations\n The Gr\noup accounts for its business combinations under \nacquisition method of accounting. Acquisition related costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred. The acquiree\u2019s identifiable assets, \nliabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the condition for recognition are recognised at their fair values at the \nacquisition date.\n P\nurchase consideration paid in excess of the fair value \nof net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Where \nthe fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities exceed the cost of acquisition, after reassessing the fair values \nof the net assets and contingent liabilities, the excess is \nrecognised as capital reserve.\n The in\nterest of non-controlling shareholders is initially \nmeasured either at fair value or at the non-controlling \ninterests\u2019 proportionate share of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable \nnet assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an \nacquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, \nthe carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the \namount of those interests at initial recognition plus the \nnon-controlling interests\u2019 share of subsequent changes in \nequity of subsidiaries.\n Business c\nombinations arising from transfers of interests in \nentities that are under common control are accounted at \nhistorical cost.

The right-of-use asset is \nsubsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted \nfor any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the \ncommencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use \nassets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment \nwhenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the \nstatement of profit and loss.\n The Gr\noup measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement \ndate of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily \ndetermined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably \nsimilar characteristics, the Group, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease \nor the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease \npayments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that \noption and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate \nthe lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease \nliability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any \nreassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Group recognises the amount \nof the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit \nand loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Group recognises any remaining amount of the re-\nmeasurement in statement of profit and loss.\n The Gr\noup has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease \nterm of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these \nleases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n Gr\noup as a lessor\n A\nt the inception of the lease the Group classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The Group \nrecognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In case of a \nfinance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on \nthe lessor\u2019s net investment in the lease. When the Group is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease \nand the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from \nthe head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Group applies the \nexemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease.\n If an arr\nangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Group applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with \ncustomers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\n The de\ntails of the right-of-use assets held by the Group is as follows:\n(` crore)\nAdditions for  \nthe year ended \nMarch 31, 2023Net carrying  \namount as at  \nMarch 31, 2023\nLeasehold land  179  940 \nBuildings  1,236  6,330 \nLeasehold improvements  14  30 \nComputer equipment  73  125 \nSoftware licences  -     96 \nVehicles  17  34 \nOffice equipment  1  5 \n 1,520  7,560", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4547, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "60dbb08c-ea20-4eb2-818c-9a9257ac443e": {"__data__": {"id_": "60dbb08c-ea20-4eb2-818c-9a9257ac443e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "269636fb-bd9e-480b-bca0-e65cb9cae986", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "216", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "6c9603772888d3ac8959a8494b41feb9e89af474171e569eae0d77422f7bf042", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e5b68f1d-e319-4a15-a1ad-fac711ca0ac3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "215", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "fd92765af708d6373191ec25dba735b280aab32f55e635fb085038020652340a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3cdf384a-3482-467f-8305-5fd69c6abace", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "db2247f789d83e2b9cba248598d8dd2f4a4eaf567df9dd7a06c74be278933748", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes forming part of Consolidated Financial StatementsConsolidated Financial Statements 2022-23  |  216\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23(` crore)\nAdditions for  \nthe year ended \nMarch 31, 2022Net carrying  \namount as at  \nMarch 31, 2022\nLeasehold land  100  774 \nBuildings  1,357  6,586 \nLeasehold improvements  -     23 \nComputer equipment  4  81 \nSoftware licences  145  133 \nVehicles  16  32 \nOffice equipment  2  7 \n 1,624  7,636 \n Depr\neciation on right-of-use assets is as follows:\n(` crore)\nYear ended  \nMarch 31, 2023Year ended  \nMarch 31, 2022\nLeasehold land 10  9 \nBuildings 1,530  1,465 \nLeasehold improvements  6  6 \nComputer equipment  32  23 \nSoftware licences 37  38 \nVehicles  16  16 \nOffice equipment  3  3 \n1,634  1,560 \n \nIntere st on lease liabilities is `492 crore and `519 crore for for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n The Gr\noup incurred `318 crore and `277 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, towards expenses \nrelating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.\n The t\notal cash outflow for leases is `2,538 crore and `2,228 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, \nincluding cash outflow for short term and low value leases.\n The Gr\noup has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities.

The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable \nconsideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and \nincentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant \nfinancing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for \na distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction \nprice only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will \nnot occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Group allocates the elements of variable considerations \nto all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct \nperformance obligations.\n The Gr\noup exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a period \nof time. The Group considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls \nthe asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such \nproduct or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.\n Con\ntract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for \ncapitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of \nthis criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be \nused to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.\n Con\ntract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified \nas unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of \ntime is required, as per contractual terms.\n Unearned and de\nferred revenue (\u201ccontract liability\u201d) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.\n The billing schedules agr\need with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress \npayments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.\n In acc\nordance with Ind AS 37, the Group recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the \nobligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.\n Con\ntracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Group reviews \nmodification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company\u2019s policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\nAuditors\u2019 Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit \nevidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to \nFinancial StatementsA company\u2019s internal financial controls with reference to financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company offers a consulting-led, cognitive powered, integrated portfolio of IT, business and engineering services and solutions. This is delivered through its unique Location-Independent Agile delivery model recognised as a benchmark of excellence in software development.\n The Compan\ny is a public limited company incorporated and \ndomiciled in India. The address of its corporate office is TCS House, Raveline Street, Fort, Mumbai - 400001. As at  March 31, 2023, Tata Sons Private Limited, the holding company owned 72.27% of the Company\u2019s equity share capital.\n The Boar\nd of Directors approved the standalone financial \nstatements for the year ended March 31, 2023 and authorised for issue on April 12, 2023.\n2)\n St\natement of compliance\n These s\ntandalone financial statements have been prepared \nin accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (referred to as \u201cInd AS\u201d) as prescribed under section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as amended from time to time.\n3)\n Basis of pr\neparation\n These s\ntandalone financial statements have been prepared \non historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments and defined benefit plans which are measured at fair value or amortised cost at the end of each reporting period. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current and non-current as per the Company\u2019s normal operating cycle. Based on the nature of services rendered to customers and time elapsed between deployment of resources and the realisation in cash and cash equivalents of the consideration for such services rendered, the Company has considered an operating cycle of 12 months.\n The s\ntatement of cash flows has been prepared under \nindirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows. The cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of the Company are segregated. The Company considers all highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value to be cash equivalents. These s tandalone financial statements have been prepared \nin Indian Rupee ( `) which is the functional currency of the \nCompany. Foreign currency transactions are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transaction. Foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet dates and exchange gains and losses arising on settlement and restatement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in foreign currencies are not retranslated.\n The signific\nant accounting policies used in preparation of \nthe standalone financial statements have been discussed in the respective notes.\n4)\n Use of es\ntimates and judgements\n \n The pr\neparation of standalone financial statements \nin conformity with the recognition and measurement principles of Ind AS requires management of the Company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported balances of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent liabilities as at the date of standalone financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses for the periods presented.\n Es\ntimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on \nan ongoing basis.

The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments.\n(e)\n Pr\novision for income tax and deferred tax assets\n The Compan\ny uses estimates and judgements based on \nthe relevant rulings in the areas of allocation of revenue, costs, allowances and disallowances which is exercised while determining the provision for income tax. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Company exercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting period.\n(f)\n Pr\novisions and contingent liabilities\n The Compan\ny estimates the provisions that have present \nobligations as a result of past events and it is probable that outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n The Compan\ny uses significant judgements to assess \ncontingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are recognised when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made.

These assumptions have been explained under employee benefits note.\n(h)\n Leases\n The Compan\ny evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a \nlease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification of a lease requires significant judgement. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.\n The Compan\ny determines the lease term as the non-\ncancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company \nis reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease.\n The disc\nount rate is generally based on the incremental \nborrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\n5)\n R\necent pronouncements\n Minis\ntry of Corporate Affairs (\u201cMCA\u201d) notifies new standard \nor amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time.

Financial assets and liabilities are initially measured at fair value, except for trade receivables which are initially measured at transaction price. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted from the fair value measured on initial recognition of financial asset or financial liability.\n The Compan\ny derecognises a financial asset only when the \ncontractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Company\u2019s obligations are discharged, \ncancelled or have expired.\n Cash and c\nash equivalents\n The Compan\ny considers all highly liquid investments, which \nare readily convertible into known amounts of cash that are \nsubject to an insignificant risk of change in value, to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of balances with banks which are unrestricted for withdrawal and usage.\n Financial asse\nts at amortised cost\n Financial asse\nts are subsequently measured at amortised \ncost if these financial assets are held within a business \nwhose objective is to hold these assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual terms of the financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n \n Financial asse\nts at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income\n Financial asse\nts are measured at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income if these financial assets are held \nwithin a business whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows on specified dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding and selling financial assets.\n The Compan\ny has made an irrevocable election to present \nsubsequent changes in the fair value of equity investments not held for trading in other comprehensive income.\n Financial asse\nts at fair value through profit or loss\n Financial asse\nts are measured at fair value through profit \nor loss unless they are measured at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income on initial recognition. The transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are immediately recognised in statement of profit and loss.\n In\nvestment in subsidiaries\n In\nvestment in subsidiaries are measured at cost less \nimpairment loss, if any.\n Financial liabilities\n Financial liabilities ar\ne measured at amortised cost using \nthe effective interest method.\n E\nquity instruments\n An equity ins\ntrument is a contract that evidences residual \ninterest in the assets of the company after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by the Company are recognised at the proceeds received net of direct issue cost.\n Deriv\native accounting\n \u2022\n Ins\ntruments in hedging relationship\n \n The Compan\ny designates certain foreign exchange \nforward, currency options and futures contracts as \nhedge instruments in respect of foreign exchange risks. These hedges are accounted for as cash flow hedges.\n \n The Compan\ny uses hedging instruments that are \ngoverned by the policies of the Company which are approved by the Board of Directors. The policies provide written principles on the use of such financial derivatives consistent with the risk management strategy of the Company.\n \n The hedg\ne instruments are designated and \ndocumented as hedges at the inception of the contract. The Company determines the existence of an economic relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item based on the currency, amount and timing of their respective cash flows. The effectiveness of hedge instruments to reduce the risk associated with the exposure being hedged is assessed and measured at inception and on an ongoing basis. If the hedged future cash flows are no longer expected to occur, then the amounts that have been accumulated in other equity are immediately reclassified in net foreign exchange gains in the statement of profit and loss.\n \n The e\nffective portion of change in the fair value of the \ndesignated hedging instrument is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading cash flow hedging reserve.\n \n The Compan\ny separates the intrinsic value and \ntime value of an option and designates as hedging instruments only the change in intrinsic value of the option.

Ind AS 109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses for all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowances for doubtful trade receivables, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade receivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for forward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance rates used in the provision matrix.

The Company has a risk management policy which covers risks \nassociated with the financial assets and liabilities. The risk management policy is approved by the Board of Directors. The focus of the risk management committee is to assess the unpredictability of the financial environment and to mitigate potential adverse effects on the financial performance of the Company.\n Mark\net risk\n Mark\net risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market \nprices. Such changes in the values of financial instruments may result from changes in the foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, credit, liquidity and other market changes. The Company\u2019s exposure to market risk is primarily on account of foreign currency exchange rate risk.\n \u2022\n F\noreign currency exchange rate risk\n \n The fluctua\ntion in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the statement of profit and loss and other \ncomprehensive income and equity, where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets / liabilities are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company. Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries.\n \n The Compan\ny, as per its risk management policy, uses derivative instruments primarily to hedge foreign exchange. Further, \nany movement in the functional currency of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact the Company\u2019s revenue in international business.\n \n The Compan\ny evaluates the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations by assessing its exposure to exchange rate risks. It \nhedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.\n \n The f\noreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a \nsimultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the functional currency of the Company.\n \n The f\nollowing analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures of the Company as of the date of balance sheet \nwhich could affect the statements of profit and loss and other comprehensive income and equity.

The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial \nmeasurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\n The Compan\ny measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement \ndate of the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. If that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar characteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the incremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease modifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement of lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the nature of modification. Where the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement in statement of profit and loss.\n The Compan\ny has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 Leases to short-term leases of all assets that have a lease \nterm of 12 months or less and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value. The lease payments associated with these leases are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n Compan\ny as a lessor\n \n A\nt the inception of the lease the Company classifies each of its leases as either an operating lease or a finance lease. The \nCompany recognises lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  In case of a finance lease, finance income is recognised over the lease term based on a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the lessor\u2019s net investment in the lease. When the Company is an intermediate lessor it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sub-lease separately. It assesses the lease classification of a sub-lease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a head lease is a short-term lease to which the Company applies the exemption described above, then it classifies the sub-lease as an operating lease. \n If an arr\nangement contains lease and non-lease components, the Company applies Ind AS 115 Revenue from contracts with \ncustomers to allocate the consideration in the contract.\n The de\ntails of the right-of-use assets held by the Company is as follows:\n(` crore)\nAdditions for  \nthe year ended \nMarch 31, 2023Net carrying  \namount as at  \nMarch 31, 2023\nLeasehold land  179  940 \nBuildings  799  4,608 \nLeasehold improvement  -     2 \nComputer equipment  -     49 \nSoftware licences  -     96 \nVehicles  -    -*\n 978  5,695 \n *R\nepresents value less than `0.50 crore.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4939, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b5d18a7-f870-4973-9f31-98c124ab81e3": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b5d18a7-f870-4973-9f31-98c124ab81e3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "287", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1cd3e757-4f2d-44ed-8fb1-556fae3e8c36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "287", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "95b728c59cd5fd09107f7f218a132c8e61006128f0f91cb8f10e3e9aed9d268e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3fb4b347-5e22-41dd-984f-564f47de74a2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "286", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "fce3481066d93249c3457b7ba8963a24ba63a259ab0c9e9cdbf98626dda72c51", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6b304f15-ad1b-4b76-ad0a-69c5c64253aa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1fc4d45696e07e1158b77cc32fe01f6e0a0b90b2aefc8883a35722631a810978", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  287\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23(` crore)\nAdditions for  \nthe year ended \nMarch 31, 2022Net carrying  \namount as at  \nMarch 31, 2022\nLeasehold land  100  774 \nBuildings  779  4,860 \nLeasehold improvement  -     4 \nComputer equipment  3  66 \nSoftware licences  145  133 \nVehicles -* -*\n 1,027  5,837 \n *R\nepresents value less than `0.50 crore.\n Depr\neciation on right-of-use assets is as follows:\n(` crore)\nYear ended  \nMarch 31, 2023Year ended  \nMarch 31, 2022\nLeasehold land  10  9 \nBuildings  1,034  991 \nLeasehold improvement  2  3 \nComputer equipment  16  15 \nSoftware licences  37  38 \nVehicles -*  1 \n 1,099  1,057 \n *R\nepresents value less than `0.50 crore.\n In\nterest on lease liabilities is `421 crore and `451 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n The Compan\ny incurred `211 crore and `162 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, towards expenses \nrelating to short-term leases and leases of low-value assets.\n The t\notal cash outflow for leases is `1,732 crore and `1,561 crore for the years ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, \nincluding cash outflow for short term and low value leases.\n The Compan\ny has lease term extension options that are not reflected in the measurement of lease liabilities.

The \nCompany assesses the products / services promised in a contract and identifies distinct performance obligations in the contract. \nIdentification of distinct performance obligation involves judgement to determine the deliverables and the ability of the customer to benefit independently from such deliverables.\n Judg\nement is also required to determine the transaction price for the contract and to ascribe the transaction price to each \ndistinct performance obligation. The transaction price could be either a fixed amount of customer consideration or variable consideration with elements such as volume discounts, service level credits, performance bonuses, price concessions and incentives. The transaction price is also adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the contract includes a significant financing component. Any consideration payable to the customer is adjusted to the transaction price, unless it is a payment for a distinct product or service from the customer. The estimated amount of variable consideration is adjusted in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur and is reassessed at the end of each reporting period. The Company allocates the elements of variable considerations to all the performance obligations of the contract unless there is observable evidence that they pertain to one or more distinct performance obligations.\n The Compan\ny exercises judgement in determining whether the performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over a \nperiod of time. The Company considers indicators such as how customer consumes benefits as services are rendered or who controls the asset as it is being created or existence of enforceable right to payment for performance to date and alternate use of such product or service, transfer of significant risks and rewards to the customer, acceptance of delivery by the customer, etc.\n R\nevenue from subsidiaries is recognised based on transaction price which is at arm\u2019s length.\n Con\ntract fulfilment costs are generally expensed as incurred except for certain software licence costs which meet the criteria for \ncapitalisation. Such costs are amortised over the contractual period or useful life of licence, whichever is less. The assessment of this criteria requires the application of judgement, in particular when considering if costs generate or enhance resources to be used to satisfy future performance obligations and whether costs are expected to be recovered.\n Con\ntract assets are recognised when there are excess of revenues earned over billings on contracts. Contract assets are classified \nas unbilled receivables (only act of invoicing is pending) when there is unconditional right to receive cash, and only passage of time is required, as per contractual terms.\n Unearned and de\nferred revenue (\u201ccontract liability\u201d) is recognised when there are billings in excess of revenues.\n The billing schedules agr\need with customers include periodic performance based payments and / or milestone based progress \npayments. Invoices are payable within contractually agreed credit period.\n In acc\nordance with Ind AS 37, the Company recognises an onerous contract provision when the unavoidable costs of meeting the \nobligations under a contract exceed the economic benefits to be received.\n Con\ntracts are subject to modification to account for changes in contract specification and requirements. The Company reviews \nmodification to contract in conjunction with the original contract, basis which the transaction price could be allocated to a new performance obligation, or transaction price of an existing obligation could undergo a change. In the event transaction price is revised for existing obligation, a cumulative adjustment is accounted for.\n The Compan\ny disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by nature of services, industry verticals and geography.\n R\nevenue disaggregation by nature of services is as follows:\n(` crore)\nYear ended  \nMarch 31, 2023Year ended  \nMarch 31, 2022\nConsultancy services 1,88,748 1,59,106\nSale of equipment and software licences  1,606  1,235 \n1,90,354 1,60,341", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4484, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "da827900-b5e2-484c-b67f-abed8559800d": {"__data__": {"id_": "da827900-b5e2-484c-b67f-abed8559800d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "296", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1f69f55d-42e2-4523-81ae-e2b538aa35de", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "296", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "49d394712ca177dfe0917b53469ebff1105005cf8ac584f2da2832a5fa687446", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f7056d7b-5942-4878-820e-562545163334", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "295", "file_name": "tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\tcs 22-23.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10812472, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-15"}, "hash": "0d22149dfb4a77a9a1b98b6bd8113eacd0b913b9e0b3edb68cc882bd33426b59", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4cd16660-88ae-48fa-8ca6-2697f484e271", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a8321f9bd50c14ea46b20acf6cb721b57172aeafbb4d2a5fc64611b17df94c64", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes forming part of Standalone Financial StatementsStandalone Financial Statements 2022-23  |  296\nIntegrated Annual Report 2022-23 R evenue disaggregation by industry vertical is as follows:\n(` crore)\nYear ended  \nMarch 31, 2023Year ended  \nMarch 31, 2022\nBanking, Financial Services and Insurance  68,240  58,614 \nManufacturing  16,905  14,576 \nRetail and Consumer Business  33,169  26,966 \nCommunication, Media and Technology  33,606  28,778 \nLife Sciences and Healthcare  22,398  18,341 \nOthers  16,036  13,066 \n1,90,354 1,60,341\n R\nevenue disaggregation by geography is as follows:\n(` crore)\nYear ended  \nMarch 31, 2023Year ended  \nMarch 31, 2022\nAmericas\n North Americ\na 1,13,208  90,630 \n La\ntin America  382  314 \nEurope\n Unit\ned Kingdom  30,676  27,595 \n Con\ntinental Europe  19,209  17,595 \nAsia Pacific  12,017  11,178 \nIndia  10,941  9,547 \nMiddle East and Africa  3,921  3,482 \n1,90,354 1,60,341\n Geogr\naphical revenue is allocated based on the location of the customers.\n In\nformation about major customers\n No single cus\ntomer represents 10% or more of the Company\u2019s total revenue during the years ended March 31, 2023 and  \nMarch 31, 2022.\n While disclosing the ag\ngregate amount of transaction price yet to be recognised as revenue towards unsatisfied (or partially) \nsatisfied performance obligations, along with the broad time band for the expected time to recognise those revenues, the \nCompany has applied the practical expedient in Ind AS 115.

He reports \nto the Board sub-committee on sustainability related matters. Head, Environmental Sustainability Health and Safety (ESHS) reports to the CHRO. The ESHS team comprises of environmental sustainability professionals who monitor various climate change related data points including emissions and support the implementation of emission reduction initiatives across TCS locations in collaboration with action owners within the organization. Location level targets are monitored by the location level operations and ESHS teams. \n\u2022\n F\nor environmental risk assessment, mitigation, and adaptation, TCS has a well-defined structure with an Enterprise Risk \nManagement Unit which is headed by a Chief Risk Officer. This unit reviews all risks associated with the company operations. ERM categorizes risks and opportunities into Strategic, Operational, Financial, Compliance and Catastrophic. \n\u2022\n The risk iden\ntification process is carried out for the entire organization and its value chain to assess all risks including the physical, \ncompliance, operational and reputational risks due to climate change and the business opportunities associated with it. Unit level risk assessments are done to assess the physical risks of climate change. These are then rolled up to the enterprise-level risk portfolio register and suitably included. These risks are reviewed on a half yearly basis or as required. \n\u2022\n As T\nCS\u2019 customers respond to climate change actions, the company is seeing opportunities to provide technology-led solutions \nto help them achieve their sustainability goals.
