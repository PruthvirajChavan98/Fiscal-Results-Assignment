As businesses responded to the pandemic, many began exploring new technologies or doubling down on earlier investments, accelerating digital transformations worldwide and driving demand in areas like IT services. Across industries, companies are likely to continue investing in operational efficiency programs to reduce costs of operations, then reinvest the savings in transforming business models and leveraging new technologies. \nPerhaps most importantly, consumers \nand businesses will increasingly make choices based on trust. Systems and data need to be secure, reliable, and resilient. Similarly, customers will do business with people they trust. \nWipro is a global leader in IT services, \nand we intend to build on that reputation, establishing our brand and our clients as some of the most forward-thinking organizations in business today. \nGuided by our new strategy, \nempowered leadership, and global talent, we will deliver more comprehensive digital solutions, push the envelope with better business practices and talent management, and make real progress in building a bold tomorrow.\nEmpowering our clients\nTransforming our workforce Simplicity over perfection\nTalent is essential to our new growth strategy. We are investing heavily in our teams and nurturing top talent. We have updated our competency development programs to keep our project, delivery, and program managers equipped with the latest skills. \nWe are leveraging TopGear and Topcoder to enable \nus and our clients to tap a global talent pool of Wipro employees, as well as a highly skilled external crowd, to execute even the most challenging projects. With remote work on the rise, crowdsourcing has potential to become a key delivery model. Wipro is a front-runner in the crowdsourcing space, and we intend to use our advantage to push more innovative solutions in with this delivery model.\nRespect and inclusivity are fundamental to Wipro, \nbut last year was a reminder that we can all do more. Our new approach to talent management focuses on increasing diversity throughout our organization and providing greater support across the board to empower our employees and their growth. \nThis renewed focus on acquiring, developing, and maintaining talent will increase performance across our global teams, translating to greater innovation, efficiency, and quality.During one of the most difficult years in recent history, we embarked on a radical transformation of the Wipro organization. We shifted to the new operating model, and have been receiving great feedback from internal teams, clients, investors, and analysts. We are also moving away from traditional delivery models, encouraging delivery leaders to adopt more flexible, powerful methods of working.\nWe appointed new leaders in many roles and \nsignificantly simplified the structure at the top. This is an impressive group of people, with fresh perspectives and a lot of experience to share with our teams and our clients. We are confident that their expertise will help us advance our strategy and provide the support and leadership that is essential for long-term growth.Over the years, our mergers and acquisitions have created a vibrant community of diverse talent around the world. We are happy to continue that growth with our recent acquisitions of IVIA, 4C, Encore Theme, Eximius, CAPCO and Ampion. Acquiring CAPCO significantly strengthens our position in the global financial services market, and Ampion will help us expand our footprint in Australia, accelerating our growth in the Asia-Pacific region.\nIn April 2021, we fully integrated seven of our \npreviously acquired companies and subsets of those individual brands.

So, whether it is digital commerce, online education, or telemedicine, technology-enabled business models have emerged across the board, with Cloud technology as the cornerstone of this transformation. \nAs vaccination efforts ramp up globally, and \neconomies start seeing a rebound, our customers are ever so keen to invest in and accelerate their digital transformation. For companies such as ours, the key to success is to respond to this opportunity with speed and agility. \nWith the rapid shift to digital, the demand for talent \nwill outpace supply, and become a key dependency for growth. Already we see new delivery models, such as \u2018work from anywhere\u2019 and \u2018Crowdsourcing\u2019 , become the mainstay. We expect virtual, remote, community-based, and distributed work models to be the future of work. \nBuilding a Bold Tomorrow  \nfor Wipro\nI believe Wipro is well-positioned to leverage, as well \nas enable such transformations. In the last six months, we have effected bold changes to help serve our customers better. \nEarly last year, we set out to make the first bold \nchange, embracing the direction set by our new CEO & Managing Director, Thierry Delaporte. The Board and I cannot be more confident of Thierry, and his leadership. As a result, I feel more optimistic about our future than ever before.\nThe difficult but necessary changes we have made, \nhas made us a stronger and better organization. \nProximity to customers is key, as is reflected in our \nnew business model. \nDeep and prioritized focus on countries, industry \nsectors, offerings, and partnership, along with an operating structure that makes us agile and nimble in a post-crisis world, that will be all about impact at speed. Overall, I see a much stronger external market orientation at Wipro. Several new leaders have joined us to take forward this transformation. \nThe acquisition of CAPCO, a leading strategy and \nconsulting firm in the Banking and Financial Services Industry, was our largest ever and another bold move for us. With a purchase consideration of $1.45 billion, CAPCO brings to us over $700 million in annual revenues and over 5,000 consultant colleagues around the world. With this acquisition, we are now in a select league of service providers, who provide integrated end-to-end consulting, digital, cloud and IT transformation services for the BFSI sector at scale. It also expands our presence into a large set of strategic clients uniquely complementary to our existing customer base. Most importantly, CAPCO and Wipro share similar culture and values. \nBuilding a Bold Tomorrow  \nfor our employees\nAs I write this letter, India, where over 160,000 of our \nemployees are based, is emerging out of a ravaging second wave of COVID-19. The last couple of months have been incredibly hard, mentally and emotionally, on us all. In this time of deep stress and grief, we are doing everything we can to help our employees. These include providing COVID-19 Isolation Care centers for our staff and their families, partnering with major hospitals to provide medical support to critically ill employees, additional medical reimbursement and leaves related to COVID-19, as well as vaccination at our campuses. We have also partnered with leading global EAP providers to help employees seek counselling 24x7. \nEarlier last year, when the pandemic broke out, we \ntriggered our business continuity plans to quickly enable remote working. Even today, less than 3% of our global workforce work from our offices. We have settled well into this new way of working and have continued to make our customers successful. We enjoy their confidence, and I have no doubt that a hybrid model may well be how we work in the future. But for the inspirational, inclusive and seamless teamwork, this massive change wouldn\u2019t have been possible. We must take a moment to recognize and celebrate the tremendous commitment and ownership our teams have demonstrated. \nDear Stakeholders,\nThis has been an unimaginable year. And despite all the pain and suffering, the unbreakable human spirit shines through \u2013 in the large and small acts of kindness, empathy and compassion. \nIn many ways, humanity has come together to fight \nthis global pandemic. Global cooperation has never been more important than it is now. The vaccines for COVID-19 are one of the greatest examples of collaboration and pioneering science. We must now work to scale the supply chain, build mechanisms for equitable distribution and drive an efficient administration for these life-saving vaccines.We complete 75 years since \nincorporation!", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4794, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1648b566-bb89-4cc3-a6e2-e00da9c52dd2": {"__data__": {"id_": "1648b566-bb89-4cc3-a6e2-e00da9c52dd2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1149cbe8-ee3e-4f62-b4ad-8bc0c3d22f8f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "89327cb71f453fc09fa21cf011a1057a4b19f35d5c07d5b1e60f352c8d681e89", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "43bb2af0-6d26-4c20-8566-9f4192e83c7e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "270b176c577ede6873465aa999f319a4c8d251a995239c5689b8702213151ad3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c09c1952-10c4-461c-bb90-00e5bd271114", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ba2adc4d30e2389950d56fc7240957f9d6c83cf7641f981852d9570d280a2c93", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We enjoy their confidence, and I have no doubt that a hybrid model may well be how we work in the future.

Our responsibility towards our communities has increased manifold.\nIn April 2020, Wipro Ltd, Wipro Enterprises Pvt. Ltd. \nand Azim Premji Foundation, together committed C1,125 crore (~$150M) towards tackling the unprecedented health and humanitarian crisis arising from the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. \nOver the past 12 months, we have supported more \nthan 1,500 projects covering humanitarian aid, integrated healthcare support, and livelihood regeneration. Cumulatively, we have reached out directly to more than 18 million people through our coordinated and comprehensive COVID-19 response, to provide humanitarian aid and help with livelihoods regeneration. \nTo deal with the unprecedented second wave, we \nhave ramped up our response on multiple fronts - our approach has been to address short-term emergency response as well as contribute towards strengthening our public health infrastructure. The\u00a0hospital we had set up in Pune, in the Indian state of Maharashtra, by converting our tech-campus into a 450-bed Covid-care hospital, continues to save lives. \nOur overall healthcare efforts have built capacity \nand run programs, closely collaborating with the public health system, to serve geographies that have a population of over 150 million people. \nThe other major challenge facing humanity today is \nthe climate crisis. Wipro has always believed that businesses must be at the forefront to address this challenge. Wipro\u2019s climate change program goes back nearly two decades, and this year we announced our commitment to achieving Net-Zero Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 2040, in line with the objectives of the Paris agreement. Our approach emphasizes the importance of not just reaching that goal but doing so in a way that aligns with Wipro\u2019s core values of integrity and business responsibility.\nOur Performance & Return to Shareholders\nEven as we focused on our employees\u2019 safety and customers\u2019 success, we drove focused action on our costs to respond to a deceleration in revenues in the first quarter of the year as the pandemic took hold globally. Just as effectively, we quickly pivoted to meet the rising demand, through an efficient supply chain in the second half of the financial year. For the year ending 31st March 2021, our IT Services Revenues was at $8.1 billion, a decline of 1.4% YoY in reported currency. Our Net Income at D107.9 billion grew by 11%  YoY aided by improved operating margins. We also \nended the year with strong order booking, including two mega billion-dollar deal wins. For the full year, the EPS was at D19.11 per share, up 14.6% YoY , and the Operating Cash Flows at D147.6 billion was at  136.7% of our Net Income. Our Gross Cash was at $4.7 billion and Net Cash was at $3.6 billion. Our pay-out for FY21 was at D122.1 billion through buyback and dividends (including dividend distribution tax) to our shareholders, which is 113.1% of our Net Income. Our market cap and share price increased by over 108% in the last 12 months.\nOur Values & Growth mindset\nThis year is special. We complete 75 years since incorporation! This fabulous journey would not have been possible but for the tireless efforts of our employees, their dedication and inventiveness. They embody the true spirit of Wipro! As a result, Wipro is recognized the world over as an exemplar of corporate citizenship with the highest standards of governance, ethics, and values. \nI personally champion this culture, mindset and ways \nof working, something we call the Five Habits: Being Respectful, Being Responsive, Always Communicating, Demonstrating Stewardship, and Building Trust. Embarking on and sparking a cultural movement was a strategic imperative for us, allowing Wipro to focus on driving a growth mindset across the firm. \nI am thankful to our clients, partners, employees, and \nother stakeholders who have placed their trust and confidence in us. I am very excited about the path we are on, and confident you will see a bolder and more ambitious Wipro as we move forward, that is unafraid to shake up the status quo, make tough calls, invest deep, and think big.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4293, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c77855a4-ac62-4c18-a92d-eba4aebe8661": {"__data__": {"id_": "c77855a4-ac62-4c18-a92d-eba4aebe8661", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d4a01d56-f106-43ff-b36a-b18e5336a787", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "5825837a18546c51b473dfa3ea01cc6f0c7db974a61280bdd89941e1ab614c4c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c09c1952-10c4-461c-bb90-00e5bd271114", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e0fb433f215043e0fbf00c5700af0ea41acde0fd8f715f8a9f50d6a6c2a01884", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "2e7e13db-42a9-43f0-b164-28027db8fad1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "097e2f795aac2a4d07dfc12640b62448998ba3256bd87ad4419858fa4ed4d588", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They embody the true spirit of Wipro!

The pandemic has served to accelerate this need. The time to change is now, and if your business does not, it will be left behind. This sentiment forms the precursor to our value proposition to the market: Wipro is a transformation partner you can trust. \nOur ability to deliver change is underpinned by three \ncore components. The first is Technology, which is at the heart of all transformation. Next is Talent, which drives our technological engine. The third is Trust , \nwithout it a partnership cannot be expected to thrive. \nPartners who can challenge the status quo, ideate \ntogether, provide insight, innovate, and lead with flawless execution, will always deliver value over the longer term. This has led to both business, and providers, revaluating what is important from a service. Once it used to be about cost and efficiencies. Now,  Speed and Agility matter more. The ability to \ndisrupt oneself at speed will allow a company to separate itself from its competition and take a unique position in its market.\nWe know that industry growth will largely be led by \nnext-generation technologies and services. We can therefore expect to see huge incremental growth in areas such as Digital, Cloud, Data, Engineering, Cybersecurity. \nCloud definitely is at the center of customer \nconversations, and is becoming not just the operating platform of choice but a fundamental part of Digital Transformation. The emergence of new work models such as work-from-anywhere or crowdsourcing, has meant that cybersecurity has become a top priority for businesses.\nFor long, Wipro has been helping customers navigate \nthe full spectrum of IT transformation. Our customers appreciate our passion for innovation, our commitment to excellence in delivery, and that we are invested \u2013 and invest in \u2013 our customer\u2019s success. \nThat said, our ambition is to constantly raise the bar \nand be a true global leader of our industry. In order to realize this, we have made bold changes ourselves, challenge our existing areas of focus, our approach to growth, and our ability to deliver excellence across all markets, in all sectors, for all customers.\nWe are Building a Bolder Tomorrow for Wipro through \nour five-point strategy:\n1.\n \n \nAccelerating growth by prioritizing the sectors \nand markets we operate in. We are channeling our \nefforts and investments for maximum results, going deeper in areas we believe we have strengths in, while doubling down and scaling in those areas we are winning in, to secure a leadership position. \n2.\n \n Str\nengthening clients and partnerships with \nstrategic clients by investing in good talent and a focused structure that can shape and win larger transformational deals. We are also leveraging relationships with our strategic partners and using M&A as a key strategic enabler to accelerate growth.\n3.\n \n L\neading with business solutions that enhance \nour portfolio, resonate with our clients, and align with business and functional spend pools. We are developing and scaling these solutions by leveraging industry expertise, technology capability and ecosystem partnerships. \n4.\n \n Buil\nding talent at scale. This will be the most \ncritical factor for success. An ambitious program to scale talent across front-end, domain and technology areas are playing out at Wipro as we speak. I am also committed to building leadership diversity throughout our business, including most importantly, our leadership ranks. Industry-leading growth will only come from industry-leading plurality.Dear Stakeholders,\nIt has been my privilege and honor to lead Wipro for the past year, an exceptional company that is both an industry pioneer, and a force for good in the communities which we serve. \nThe financial year that ended March 31, 2021 capped \na landmark 12 months for Wipro, a period of total transformation. We announced a new strategy, completed the biggest organizational restructuring in our history, delivered strong performances for consecutive quarters, and sealed our largest-ever acquisition, all in the middle of a global pandemic. We finished FY21 with healthy revenue growth, prestigious deal wins, strong margins and robust cash flows. \nChange takes time, but I am pleased to share that we \nare now well-settled into these new ways of working and remain resolutely focused on fulfilling our customers\u2019 needs.Technology is at the core of \nbusiness transformation, but \ntalent remains the driving \nforce. In the new world of work, \nWipro\u2019s commitment is to our \nclients\u2019 success, and to that of \nour employees, and the larger \ncommunity.\nThierry Delaporte, CEO\n23 22\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited\nBuilding a Bold Tomorrow", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4891, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2611eb6b-2fc2-42a0-8b86-640b4449c39b": {"__data__": {"id_": "2611eb6b-2fc2-42a0-8b86-640b4449c39b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "74ef1de5-6352-48fe-9c60-3c34eafe6253", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "2d497f4db0d2654d2c8c134b1c703930608b5e51a57debc8bde67b8924de16ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2e7e13db-42a9-43f0-b164-28027db8fad1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "94b0a77d654b2ec8b0327a7ccb6b55a4c206740acf002781a7095752bcc9305e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3a21e295-e720-4971-a645-2e1e7fd88820", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a08f236f92d32c55cb7a9dcff12857cd461ae52f00b7202a9176f16871f7d9e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "5.  Simplifying our oper ating model will drive better \ncustomer-centricity, agility and empower our teams \nwho are closest to the clients to make decisions without excessive oversight or controls. This is what we have done in the past year. Our new model fosters accountability and an entrepreneurial spirit. \nBusiness Performance in FY 2020-21\nA high-performance organization is a great asset. It builds and strengthens the foundation for sustained growth. Our IT Services revenues for the full year was $8.1 billion. Our revenue growth during the last two quarters of the year was 3.3% and 3.0% respectively, which on constant currency terms means they were the best quarters in terms of growth in the last decade! Despite a steep decline in the first quarter of the fiscal year, as the result of the pandemic, we bounced back to finish the year with only a marginal decline of 1.4% YoY .\nOur renewed focus on the market, and on customers, \nensured that the total contract value of our order book in H2\u201921 grew by 33% YoY. This was a result of increased activity in the market, which I must say we have leveraged very well. A second factor in that trajectory were the closure of large deals. We closed 24 large deals in second half of the year, resulting in a Total Contract Value of $2.6 billion. This includes two mega deals, one in Europe, and one in the Americas market, each of which can lead to revenues of more than $ 1 billion over the deal duration.\nAs you can tell from our approach, mergers and \nacquisitions have been an integral part of our business strategy. In the second half of the financial year, we closed several acquisitions across several key markets, including the US, Europe, LATAM, Australia and India. These acquisitions have strengthened our local presence, and service offerings. Our largest-ever acquisition, CAPCO, for $1.45 billion is one that significantly strengthens our position in the global financial services market. This acquisition also allows us to onboard some exceptional domain experts and talent in that space. Our strategic M&As over the years have contributed towards the creation of a vibrant, new-age, and diverse community of talent around the world. Such talent, along with the new cadre of leadership that has joined the existing executive team, brings to Wipro the kind of leadership that is not typical for our industry historically. We will continue to build on this by recruiting local talent that is diverse in every way. \nWe are pleased with our rigor in execution, which \nhas resulted in Operating Margins of 20.3% for the full year, and an expansion of 220 basis points in the financial year. Our operating metrics have shown consistent improvement, with utilization and offshoring being at its highest ever. I am pleased to share that we released salary increments and promotions, covering approximately 80% of our employee base, effective of January 1, 2021. We also had a robust operating cash flow generation of D147.6 billion, which was at 136.7% of Net Income for the year. In addition, we ended the year with $3.6\u00a0billion in cash on our balance sheet.\nOur commitment to our employees and \ncommunities \nOur pursuit of excellence will not be possible without \nthe commitment, endeavor and spirit of each of our 200,000+ colleagues, and especially so during a global pandemic. \nNaturally, the health, safety, and wellbeing of our \nemployees has been, and always will be, of paramount importance to us. Right at the onset of the pandemic in March 2020, we enabled our employees globally to work from home. Over the last few quarters, less than 3% of our employees have worked from Wipro offices. This was possible because of the understanding, empathy and generosity of our customer. We actively worked with our customers to reduce employee footprint in offices. \nIn many countries, but in India especially, the \npandemic has caused immeasurable loss and suffering. It was our moral obligation to do everything we could possibly for our colleagues and their loved ones. We ramped up efforts on multiple fronts, but especially focused on oxygen provisioning, Covid-testing, providing end-to-end provisions such as ambulances, treatments and managing hospital admissions. We created Wipro-sponsored Covid-isolation centers in various cities for our employees and their immediate family members. We also partnered with top-tier hospitals and a tech-enabled online-to-offline delivery platform specializing in primary care and urgent response services to provide COVID-19 vaccination support to our India-based employees.

We have always taken pride in being a responsible global citizen \u2013 one that engages with its key stakeholders to find solutions to the most pressing ecological and social issues of our time. Our business should not be detached from the evolving climate crisis. Wipro has long since built ecological sustainability practices into its operations and ways of working, often ahead of what has been considered necessary within our industry.

During the pandemic, companies across the world accelerated their digital transformation initiatives to address these disruptions and secure their businesses. While some companies have now set up advanced business continuity measures, others have embarked on new innovative services and products. As companies focused on protecting employees from the pandemic, technology enabled a seamless transition to remote working by shifting to digital channels and digital customer engagement models. Various stay at home orders resulted in large scale adoption of models such as buy-online-pickup-in-store in retail, tele-medicine and virtual care in healthcare, touchless experiences in finance and virtual solutions for online learning.\nAccording to the Strategic Review 2021 published \nby NASSCOM (the \u201cNASSCOM Report\u201d), India\u2019s technology industry is forecasted to grow at 2.3% to reach approximately $194 billion in fiscal year 2021 (excluding e-commerce). According to the NASSCOM Report, exports are estimated to grow at 1.9% to reach approximately $150 billion in fiscal year 2021 and the domestic sector is forecasted to reach approximately $45 billion in fiscal year 2021, growing at 3.4%. According to the NASSCOM Report, the growth is driven by increased demand for digital transformation and infrastructure modernization.As per the NASSCOM Report, digital revenues account for 28-30% of total industry revenues for fiscal year 2021, growing at five times the overall services growth. Share of digital services in new contracts is up by 90% from fiscal year 2020, driven by cloud, collaboration and cybersecurity. The growth of cloud, artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d), machine learning (\u201cML \u201d), internet of things (\u201cIoT\u201d), analytics, automation and collaboration software were accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, led by remote working and transformation engagements for contactless activities and customer experience. It is expected that the IT services industry will move to hybrid work models, with implications on hiring, team structures, compliance and cybersecurity.\nGlobal IT service providers offer a range of end\u2013to-end \nsoftware development, digital services, IT business solutions, research and development services, technology infrastructure services, business process services, consulting and related support functions. \nThe conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic \ncontinue to evolve as new variants of the virus are emerging in some of our markets, leaving the recovery outlook varied and uncertain. Despite demand stability being high and ongoing large-scale vaccination drives, economic outlook remains uncertain. However, companies will continue to invest in digital transformation to address new pandemic-driven consumer behaviors with the support of technology.\n30 Building a Bold Tomorrow", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3040, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2bafa1ba-c894-4ef9-ac71-f9ae83d2f24d": {"__data__": {"id_": "2bafa1ba-c894-4ef9-ac71-f9ae83d2f24d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "24ce193f-e8b1-43fb-a0d3-373af0b4b47f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "fc1ae234047ea8614ee1a195ea7c7114f419128e2ff91eb46e7bc9006d205af9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "da537a91-e3b7-467c-82b5-b0b091defe3b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "1", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "80184efe90a3eb1b65f03bfa8eff17792a4d0384f6838188abb86bab2b9aa80c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "345c5feb-389b-4059-8d71-d31e61274f36", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "58e3d3fb710118d62214129ebdacf5fe9964930b4929bb90ab45a78d8ef20959", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Business Overview\nCOVID-19 Impact on our BusinessWe are a global technology services firm, with \nemployees in over 55 countries and serving enterprise clients across various industries.

Stakeholders identification \nis based on attributes such as Impact, Influence, Interest, Legitimacy, Urgency and Diverse Perspective. These attributes help identify stakeholders across value chain that are important to business and necessitates meaningful engagement. Based on these attributes, we identified eight stakeholder groups - Employees, Customers, Investors, Suppliers, Education System, Communities & civil societies, Government and Policy Networks and The Young Citizen and Future Generation. We believe stakeholder inclusiveness is central to the materiality determination process and it is important to consider reasonable expectations and interests of stakeholders so as to provide a balanced view of the issues that emerge. \n1Refer to Summary of Stakeholder Engagement\n2Materiality Determination Exercise at https:/ /www.wipro.com/\ncontent/dam/nexus/en/sustainability/sustainability_reports/wipro-\nsustainability-report-2019-20.pdfMateriality determination for the organization is based \non a comprehensive process that include an internal materiality determination and external benchmarking with peers and sustainability standards. A significant part of materiality determination stems from the organization\u2019s overall mission, values, commitments and competitive strategy as well as the impact of or on its economic performance. An internal perspective on risks as identified through organizational processes like risk assessment studies and audits or self-assessments using disclosure frameworks like financial/sustainability reports, DJSI, CDP , etc. is considered. For external benchmarking, we conduct an extensive review of literature to identify issues considered as material and identified as risks by our business peers and also to understand expectations expressed in international standards and agreements like Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB). The issues are then prioritized based on multiple dimensions of risk, returns and relevance. \nStakeholders \nidentification is based on \nattributes such as Impact, \nInfluence, Interest, \nLegitimacy, Urgency, and \nDiverse Perspective.\n43\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2277, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3cca3b3-0d10-4d5b-8dce-9ecb8a15b88e": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3cca3b3-0d10-4d5b-8dce-9ecb8a15b88e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "90c44394-30a6-4552-b425-9dae4a1198d7", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "15", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "94028d185f0a374abae700b3ee4173aaa08edafa35c854ac2592e6957d13a1b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f832698b-74ad-4916-8bdf-81bf26d6a861", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "df0d47d75bd8298402ccaff8ccfe5bd4c13175a7d916d4f7d4989093f48d8bbc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "42a661fa-c2e5-4dcf-acdf-a535c6c97570", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7968f447a18def782d6c0be44e3cb6ae0da7b400227bfa76dadd8b6af66323ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "We have used capital framework namely Financial, Human, Intellectual, Social & \nRelationship and Natural capitals to report on value created by the organization across its value chain.

Our IT Services \nsegment revenue increased by 2.0%. The revenue of all SMUs, except for Americas 2, grew during the year, with growth led by Europe and APMEA. The growth in these SMUs was led by a surge in demand for IT services by our customers, a ramp up of our new deal wins and depreciation of the Indian Rupee against foreign currencies, including the Euro, Pound Sterling and Australian Dollar. The decline in revenues from Americas 2 was primarily due to reduction in revenue from the banking, financial services and insurance sector and manufacturing sector.\nRevenue of the IT Products segment declined by \n34.1%, which was primarily due to our focus on providing IT products as a complement to our IT services offerings, rather than selling standalone IT products, as well as our change in strategy to focus on consulting and digital engagements with ISRE clients rather than SI engagements.\nRevenue of the ISRE segment increased by 12.1%, \nwhich was primarily due to improved execution of SI deals during the year ended March 31, 2021.\nProfitability\nIn absolute terms, cost of revenues decreased by 3.0%, primarily because of decrease in travel costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and lower subcontracting costs due to the Company\u2019s cost efficiency efforts. Improvement in key operational parameters and higher offshoring also contributed to this increase. This was partially offset by an increase in employee compensation due to the impact of salary increases and increase in headcount, and depreciation of the Indian Rupee against foreign currencies, including the Euro, Pound Sterling and Australian Dollar. As a result of the foregoing factors, our gross profit as a percentage of our total revenue increased by 316 basis points (\u201cbps\u201d).Selling and Marketing expenses\nOur selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased from 7.0% for the year ended March 31, 2020 to 6.7% for the year ended March 31, 2021. In absolute terms, selling and marketing expenses decreased by 3.5% primarily because of decrease in travel costs and marketing and brand building costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by an increase in depreciation, amortization and impairment, due to an impairment charge of H2,418 million on certain intangibles assets recognized on acquisitions.\nGeneral and Administrative expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased from 4.9% for the year ended March 31, 2020 to 5.6% for the year ended March 31, 2021. In absolute terms, general and administrative expenses increased by 16.3%, primarily due to increase in communication cost, rates, taxes and insurance costs and contributions towards COVID-19, included under \u201cOthers\u201d in the year ended March 31, 2021. These increases have been partially offset by the decrease in travel costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended March 31, 2020.\nFinance expenses\nOur finance expenses decreased from H7,328 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to H5,088 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. Reduction in exchange fluctuation expense due to repayment of foreign currency loans and reduction in interest rates during the year ended March 31, 2021, primarily resulted in lower finance expense.\nOther Operating income\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2021, we recorded H(81) million towards change in fair value of the callable units upon partial achievement of cumulative business targets pertaining to the sale of our hosted data center services business.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2020, we recorded \n(a) H992 million toward change in fair value of the Financial Capital\n46\nBuilding a Bold Tomorrow", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3827, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d9959ac-3914-4bc1-b0d0-f5f3152b8e6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d9959ac-3914-4bc1-b0d0-f5f3152b8e6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "007473f6-825f-49be-87ec-8a869b6b6693", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "1958a682de01a79bb98ee746189284cbfa7894d3bd0bce4d10155bae585f6537", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3bda1e76-c2c0-4347-b9b3-f329f9489118", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "588ff1016d4f6248c3ae30290efa537dac06872632c176c52dd74149e8ae6add", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "86107a12-cf8a-400d-9716-c604990b7fad", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "729af841b786b7ae03040f5021bbff53b11aee0712e2940256351656ad71108d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "callable units upon partial achievement of first and \nsecond year\u2019s business targets pertaining to the sale of our hosted data center business, and (b) H152 million toward gain on sale of assets pertaining to the divestment of the Workday and Cornerstone OnDemand business in Portugal, France and Sweden. \nAs a result of the foregoing factors, our operating \nincome increased by 16.4%, from H105,730 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to H123,053 million for the year ended March 31, 2021.

The revenue of all SMUs, except for Americas 2, grew during the year, led by Europe and APMEA. The growth in these SMUs was a result of execution of large deals and acquisitions, as well as depreciation of the Indian Rupee against foreign currencies, including Euro, Pound Sterling and Australian Dollar. The decline in revenues from Americas 2 was primarily due to reduction in revenue in the banking, financial services and insurance sector and manufacturing sector.\nOur gross profit as a percentage of our revenue \nfrom our IT Services segment increased by 254 bps, primarily because of decrease in travel costs and subcontracting costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Company\u2019s cost efficiency efforts.

This was partially offset by increased net inflow from loans and borrowings amounting to H 6,212 million. \nDividends paid in the year ended March 31, 2021 represents interim (and final) dividend declared for the year ended March 31, 2021 amounting to H 1 per share.\nWe maintain a debt/borrowing level that we have established through consideration of a number of factors including cash flow expectations, cash required for operations and investment plans. We continually monitor our funding requirements, and strategies are executed to maintain sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources, as needed.\nAs of March 31, 2021, we have deferred certain \nindirect tax liabilities and payroll related tax liabilities in certain countries, which are payable over a period of twelve months pursuant to COVID-19 relief measures enacted by the governments of the respective countries. We do not anticipate any liquidity challenges in paying these liabilities, even if such COVID-19 relief measures are withdrawn.\nAs discussed above, cash generated from operations \nis our primary source of liquidity. We believe that our cash and cash equivalents along with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements as well as repayment obligations with respect to debt and borrowings. Our choices of sources of funding will be driven with the objective of maintaining an optimal capital structure.As of March 31, 2021, we had contractual commitments of H7,490 million ($102.4 million) related to capital \nexpenditures on construction or expansion of software development facilities and H 15,411 million ($210.7 \nmillion) related to other purchase obligations. Plans to construct or expand our software development facilities are determined by our business requirements.\nWe will rely on funds generated from operations \nand external debt to fund potential acquisitions and shareholder returns. We expect that our cash and cash equivalents, investments in liquid and short-term mutual funds and the cash flows expected to be generated from our operations in the future will generally be sufficient to fund the growth aspirations, as applicable.\nWe completed our acquisition of CAPCO on April 29, \n2021, and the payment of upfront cash consideration of H108,760 million was funded through bank borrowings and cash and cash equivalents.\nIn the normal course of business, we transfer certain \naccounts receivables and net investment in finance lease (financial assets) to banks on a non-recourse basis. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 is not material. \nOur liquidity and capital requirements are affected by \nmany factors, some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our businesses and some of which arise from uncertainties related to global economies and the markets that we target for our services, as well as uncertainties around COVID-19. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nAs of March 31, 2020 and 2021, our cash and cash \nequivalents were primarily held in Indian Rupees, U.S. Dollars, Pound Sterling, Euros, Saudi Riyal, Omani Riyal, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars.\nShareholders Return\nWe have always strived to enhance shareholder value for our investors. The Company\u2019s policy has been to provide regular, stable and consistent distribution of return. There is no change in our philosophy on shareholder return.\n51\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4570, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c3d293fd-a4fe-4fce-afe4-c82688759ab3": {"__data__": {"id_": "c3d293fd-a4fe-4fce-afe4-c82688759ab3", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88b0714d-9a84-4c32-89fa-b721e113aeb6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "f0b6824dc19cc43bb661abf7d7c1d62485c0768ab44a41d0639661bfc5cece12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a131a212-4e4e-4989-95c4-e5798a2b122d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "22", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "f95785326abe2bc4c6295732cd7709b9a339f1e8c3d2c72c0adfaa22ae1d37e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e4254ac3-0049-4d29-891c-c2365c22b404", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a0b35e3b56157ec93d41cadc92b4d1d2c3ff6db013557c60fbcfd60455ab1998", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Cash dividends\nThe cash dividend paid per equity share during the \nyear ended March 31, 2020 was an interim dividend of H1, and the Board recommended the adoption of the interim dividend of H1 per equity share as the final dividend.

This resulted in a total cash outflow of H 116,445 million \n($1,592.1 million) including tax on buyback of H 21,445 \n($293.2 million). As a result of the buyback, our share capital has reduced by H 475 million ($6.5 million).\nAssessment of key risks\nGlobal economic and Geo \npolitical risks\nWe derive approximately 59% of our IT Services \nsegment revenue from the Americas (including the United States) and 27% of our IT Services segment revenue from Europe. Our business and financial performance is and will continue to be affected by economic conditions globally. Increased protectionism and the risk of global trade war, resulting in weaker global trade and economic activity could adversely affect our business. If the economy in the Americas or Europe continues to be volatile or uncertain or conditions in the global financial market deteriorate, pricing for our services may become less attractive and our clients located in these geographies may reduce or postpone their technology spending significantly. Reduction in spending on IT services may lower the demand for our services and negatively affect our revenues and profitability.Taxation risks\nOur profits for the period earned from providing services at client premises outside India are subject to tax in the country where we perform the work. Most of our taxes paid in countries other than India can be applied as a credit against our Indian tax liability to the extent that the same income is subject to taxation in India. Currently, we benefit from certain tax incentives under Indian tax laws. These tax incentives include a tax holiday from payment of Indian corporate income taxes for our businesses operating from specially designated Special Economic Zones (\u201cSEZs\u201d). Changes to these incentives and other exemptions we receive due to government policies can impact our financial performance.\nWage pressure\nOur wage costs in India have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the U.S. and Europe for comparably skilled professionals, and this has been one of our competitive advantages. However, wage increases in India may prevent us from sustaining this competitive advantage and may negatively affect our profit margins. We have historically experienced significant competition for employees from large multinational companies that have established and continue to establish offshore operations in India, as well as from companies within India. We may need to increase the levels of our employee compensation more rapidly than in the past to retain talent. Once the effective date is notified by the GoI, we may also experience increased costs in future years for employment and post-employment benefits in India as a result of the issuance of The Code on Social Security, 2020. Unless we are able to continue to increase the efficiency and productivity of our employees over the long term, wage increases may reduce our profit margins. Furthermore, any inability to increase the proportion of employees with less experience, or source talent from other low-cost locations, like Eastern Europe, China or Southeast Asia could also negatively affect our profits.Financial Capital\n52\nBuilding a Bold Tomorrow", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3982, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e4254ac3-0049-4d29-891c-c2365c22b404": {"__data__": {"id_": "e4254ac3-0049-4d29-891c-c2365c22b404", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a06518cb-881f-495b-aba5-7ff810e935fe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "24", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "5140ce30ff1cc79d22078c35dc0477915a74a17f718fcb6bb73cb733c666292c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "c3d293fd-a4fe-4fce-afe4-c82688759ab3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "23", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "f0b6824dc19cc43bb661abf7d7c1d62485c0768ab44a41d0639661bfc5cece12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e0cb6e5b-f582-441c-b52f-ddaefe2c8992", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ce2c2326a11a740ca75e6a2059946840572426d6b3ba8880d9c08e51f827e253", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Risk management procedures\nWe manage market risk through a corporate \ntreasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent control over the entire process of market risk management.

They were also encouraged to reflect on how this pandemic has changed for the better or for worse, the lives of people around them. Similarly, college students had to explore the three areas of Water, Waste, and Food through the lens of the pandemic and analyze the stresses created by it.\n65\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2842, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f5638a57-b7f9-4248-ac69-11aeb80d013e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f5638a57-b7f9-4248-ac69-11aeb80d013e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7056989e-812c-4add-a11e-ab8242eb247b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3de7659b9f98b2722b34d93895dc6fec3b67e5c96dfa38e56c7c4897620af842", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "6ab96350-57a0-4619-919e-cd26a4ea1b82", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e014c7a60d1f1c6c50e2b368ed5a54ce02343a317db09aa17b37005db9818be0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9549f0ef-208b-4c14-b793-4b02fa9185e3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "68eabc60b5777dbdbb69a9ca77008724dc169119f17a09a439dc143a594e8e65", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "TalentNext\nThe program offers Digital Technology courses to the faculty members of Engineering Colleges for 2 weeks on Industry relevant skills and certify them.

Thousands of employees across six continents and 36 countries came together virtually to participate in the Spirit of Wipro (SoW) Run and contributed towards their local charities in FY21. In the US and Canada, through our various initiatives with First Book, over 60,000 books were donated, impacting more than 28,000 children from underserved communities. Other initiatives included tree plantation drive in UKI and Romania, coastal clean-up drive in Philippines, education for disadvantaged particularly children with disabilities International Chapters\nin Singapore, South Africa and UKI and humanitarian and healthcare support against COVID-19 to the disadvantaged communities across the globe. \nIn addition, a global donation program was conducted \nfor Wipro employees to support communities that are disproportionately impacted by the pandemic.

I have had to speak to all sorts of people including family members of those who succumbed to the virus. It has been emotionally challenging for us as volunteers and those on the other side of the phone. Yet, personally I felt good to provide that moral support to patients and their family members. In my earlier organization too, I used to donate, be it money or clothes. But actually working \u201con the field\u201d , even if remotely now, gives me another level of satisfaction. Going forward, I would like to do more. After being in IT for 15 years, I want to do something different and give back to \nsociety. \u201d\nPrasad Tanksali \"I started volunteering when we were at the \npeak of the second wave. My most touching experience was with a senior citizen in Delhi, isolating in a room and we ended up chatting for almost half an hour. He was happy to have finally spoken to someone after days of being in quarantine. I have volunteered during the last lockdown to distribute food, but e-volunteering is new to me. Two takeaways from this experience are: 1) It might be just a phone call, but it makes a difference to people\u2019s lives. 2) There might not have been a face to the names, but nevertheless, there was a personal connect \nfor those few minutes.\"\nSony Shetty Around 500 employees contributed about 1,500 hours \nin helping Wipro Cares partners, distributing dry ration and hygiene kits, and organizing awareness and health camps. With introducing the concept of e-volunteering and other virtual volunteering initiatives, around 700 employees spent about 2,000 hours in helping Wipro.

The goals and objectives are jointly set with inputs from across functions. The quarterly reviews are attended by the Chairman, CEO and Chief HR Officer apart from the Chief Sustainability Officer and Global Head of Operations. We benchmark our performance with our global peers through extensive disclosures as well as a system of rigorous internal and external audits. \nManagement Approach\nAt Wipro, we have identified Energy efficiency and Green House Gases (GHG) mitigation, Water efficiency and Responsible Water management, Pollution and Waste management, and Campus Biodiversity as our most material issues and have developed programs around them. \nOur Ecological Sustainability Policy, available at \nhttps:/ /www.wipro.com/investors/corporate-governance/ forms the structural framework for our environmental programs and management systems. We have been following the guidelines of the ISO 14001 framework for nearly two decades now as one of the cornerstones of our Environmental Management System (EMS). 20 of our campus sites in India and 8 in Australia are certified to ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 (Occupational Health and Safety) standard. Other campuses are benchmarked against the same standard as a part of our internal review/audit process. We were one of the early adopters of Green Building Design with 22 of our current buildings across campuses certified to the international LEED standard (Silver, Gold, and Platinum) during commissioning. We strive to maintain the same standards in the maintenance of our facilities. \nWe have been responding to Carbon Disclosure Project \n(CDP) Climate Change Investor and Supply Chain for over 10 years. In addition we apply the Natural Capital Protocol guidelines arrive at the valuation of our natural capital (NCV) which we publish in our annual Environmental Profit and Loss account. In 2020, we also signed up as one of the 9 founding members of the \u2018Transform to Net Zero\u2019 coalition. We are part of the advisory group of CII\u2019s Climate Change Council and the India Climate Collaborative. We also chair the Bengaluru chapter of the CII-GBC Greenco chapter. \nStrategic Partnerships are key to achieving our goals \nacross the value chain. We work with renewable energy suppliers, energy efficient hardware manufacturers and service providers and other partners who help to reduce our overall GHG footprint including employee commute and business travel footprint.\nEnvironmental Risks\nThe Enterprise Risk Management and Sustainability functions at Wipro jointly oversee environmental and climate change related risk identification and mitigation. Impacts of extreme weather events, urban water stress, air pollution, waste management and their impacts on employee health and wellbeing are the most material issues we engaged with. \nIn 2020, we completed a comprehensive climate change risk assessment program, encompassing both \nphysical and transitional risks, for our major operational locations across the globe, covering India (12 cities), China, Philippines, Germany, Romania, the UK and the US. This has been carried out for two scenarios (based on the IPCC defined RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) covering medium to long term (2030-2050) time frames. In both scenarios, we see increased probability of higher incidence of water stress, and heat waves across cities. Below are the list of cities and regions where we see an increase in frequency of climate change risks under RCP 4.5 scenario (increase of global temperatures between 1.1 to 2.6 degree Celsius relative to 1986-2005).\n71\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3971, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6d40aa74-6abb-411b-af26-8e007bf7dcca": {"__data__": {"id_": "6d40aa74-6abb-411b-af26-8e007bf7dcca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c37bffc6-b22a-45e0-9ebd-60ea1c75ca25", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "8b1fb8d56fe21ebc102c486e52c1e6eb9e859048a8bce2d545de304ec309e196", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3068f9ec-3411-4856-8e7b-cd849ed9bd85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "0d34b5eacfe350f6cf544a308009852ced1f9df267efe877dbbfc72b99f72c16", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4c835849-1e86-4d26-b979-6166580fbbc7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c80c6216102ca09d0220cb6c6877ab52753dba3a9505e23defad31de60e6c00a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Energy efficiency & GHG \nmitigation\nTargets  \nWe have SBTI (Science Based Targets Initiative) \napproved targets for Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 till 2030 that are based on well below 2 degree temperature goal.

As a first principle, we will defer carbon removal projects (offsets) to the net zero target year (2040). This is in line with the science based targets approach of not using offsets for value chain emissions. Over the next few months, we will evolve a detailed plan for the same.Energy Consumption\nThe overall energy consumption from Scope 1 and 2 boundaries (operational and financial control) is 661.5 million Mjoules, compared to 915.3 million Mjoules in the previous year, a decrease of 27.7%. The total energy consumption - electricity and diesel based backup power - for office spaces in India is 151.3 million units; after including the electricity consumption for leased spaces, our global electricity consumption is 174 million units. Data centers in India contribute another 22.9 million units. \nFor India operations, about 64.85 million units \nconstitute renewable energy procured through independent PPAs (Power Purchase agreements) with private producers. Of this 60.7 million units is with green attributes (zero emissions). Another 13 million units is attributable to renewable resources for our downstream leased spaces. In total, the renewable energy footprint in our portfolio is 73.7 million units.\nPerformance Against Goals\nAbsolute Emissions\nThe absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions (India) for FY 2021 has decreased by 29% from 137,930 tons to 97,348 tons. This is due to low occupancy and resultant lesser conditioned area (50% reduction) at our offices. The dashboard below provides a summary of our Global and India GHG emissions, including data centers. The figures are net emissions for all years, after considering zero emissions for renewable energy procured. Office emissions\nThough the occupancy is low (average of 5%), the building air conditioning, lighting and allied electrical systems load use would not be proportional. From an assessment of three large campuses representing 35% of total campus area, we see that the conditioned area average was around 50%. Around 70% of the energy consumption for offices is from air conditioning system. Hence, the absolute energy consumption and emissions for buildings is not commensurate with low occupancy. We have also considered 50% of building area for calculating the area intensities.\nEmissions Intensity\nOur India office space emissions intensity (Scope 1 and Scope 2) is at 108 KgCo2 eq. per Sq. Mt. per annum, up by 24% from FY 2020 \u2013 for reasons mentioned in under 'Notes on FY21 emissions'.

We have estimated the emissions due to WFH scenario for FY21, and have included in our Scope 3 emissions portfolio. \nThe methodology* is based on incremental \nenergy consumption (electricity and natural gas) in a household in which members have transitioned to working from home, causing an increase in residential energy use. These are averages of select countries covered by various studies on remote work. The baseline energy consumption per household was derived based on IEA data of residential energy consumption by population of the country. We have considered the number of employees working from home across the following geographies \u2013 ANZ and APAC, EMEA; and LATAM & North America to calculate WFH emissions. \nThe total emissions due to WFH \nglobally is estimated at 36,230 tons of Co2 eq, with the US contributing to 36% and India contributing to 23%. Though 80% of the employees are based in India, its contribution to emissions is less due to significant lower energy intensity per capita compared to other countries. \n* Anthesis paper on Estimating Energy Consumption & GHG \nEmissions for Remote Workers \nNatural Capital\n74\nBuilding a Bold Tomorrow", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2621, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "620b3a1d-e96f-46be-a824-3d3afa9c74e5": {"__data__": {"id_": "620b3a1d-e96f-46be-a824-3d3afa9c74e5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "40c0f336-5188-4dd8-9ace-bccc9eb591aa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c84bb676a98359a29fb7d16a601eb240f3b3461916773a9e67e8831e47f64377", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1926c4b0-16d2-478d-a097-756bf9902334", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "90e1319ff20b9873ab71da627f1f2fb3747a9f6d1163b4676bb777e34447d9ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "590290dd-6878-465a-914d-72bfefea1809", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5be2c87cb74759181503f62b8ff8f1ca8129da518964205b0ddbdbdc3f0cbfd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Total Emissions\nThe overall GHG emissions across all scopes is \n447,683 tonnes, the main contributors to which are: Purchased Goods and Services (48.7%), Electricity \u2013 Purchased and Generated (19.1%), Upstream Fuel and Energy emissions (12%) and Work From Home emissions (8%).\nGHG Mitigation Measures\nOur five year GHG mitigation plan consists of three key elements \u2013 Energy Efficiency (Reduce), Renewable Energy (RE) Purchase (Replace) and Business Travel Substitution (Reduce and Replace); of this, RE procurement will contribute the maximum, 80% share to GHG emission mitigation strategy for  Scope 1 and 2.\nEnergy Efficiency\nThese measures include new retrofit technologies to improve Chiller and Air Handling Units (AHUs), integrated design and monitoring platforms.

The savings showed an increase of 21% over the previous year.\nVirtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) provide high-\ncapacity scalable infrastructure with On Demand provisioning, High Availability and High Performance Computing environment. We have enabled 9,333 VDI\u2019s to end users across locations. Thin clients being used in one of our location, which consumes less energy (80% less) compared to Desktop, resulting in savings of 1.2 million units.\nProcurement\nFor the reporting period of FY 2021, RE purchase contributed to approximately 73.7 million units or 42.6% of our total India energy consumption of which 12.9 million units are for downstream leased spaces. For details on green procurement in IT hardware and other categories, please see 'supplier section'.\nBusiness Travel and Employee Commute\nDue to the pandemic, the business travel footprint was 11% and employee commute was 21% of the previous years footprint. This includes (i) travel by air, bus, train, local conveyance and hotel stays for the category of business travel and (ii) personal cars two wheelers, public transport and Wipro arranged transport for employee commute. As things return back to normalcy, we are looking to transition to low emission travel choices and policies.\nOver the past few years, we have taken steps to \nfacilitate a shift towards improved access to public transport for employees (buses, commuter trains) and carpooling. Our carpooling initiative till the previous year had over 1 Lakh registered users across locations. In the reporting year, we had negligible car pooling trips due to majority of employees working from home as well as the requirements of COVID-19 appropriate behavior. \nWe are the first major Indian business to join EV100, \na global initiative by The Climate Group , in our commitment to transition our global fleet to electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030.\n75\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3300, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "590290dd-6878-465a-914d-72bfefea1809": {"__data__": {"id_": "590290dd-6878-465a-914d-72bfefea1809", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6f0e5c72-28a8-4e11-9633-03c18507b6b9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "05041f3db2048bd1cc388420a5900274ef8795053f8b3f4459d737468e5df05d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "620b3a1d-e96f-46be-a824-3d3afa9c74e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c84bb676a98359a29fb7d16a601eb240f3b3461916773a9e67e8831e47f64377", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1aba767b-330a-420b-a7de-5f73fa6a3e03", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8fdd0806212514b4d5a76dd4e4f187ee1badeee6df7ea6442d04ccd1885d16e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Water Responsibility\nTo ensure responsible water management in \nproximate communities, especially in locations that are prone to water scarcity.

This is backed up by targeted advocacy work through case studies, engagement with the city utility administrators and development of national guidelines. The program will also monitor and estimate the groundwater (shallow aquifer) potential for city, and recommend suggested practices for better management and integration with utility supply. In Pune, we are building a first of its kind city level data, interpretation and decision support platform for ground water management. This will closely work with citizen groups as well as the municipal authority to build appropriate capacities and catalyze on-ground interventions.

Natural Capital Impacts are calculated across six key performance indicators (KPIs) namely, GHG emissions, air pollution, water consumption, water and land pollution, waste generation and land use change. The methodology uses a value for the social cost of carbon that varies by country and geography \u2013 typically, it uses a higher discount rate for developing countries as compared to developed countries. \nFor calculating impacts due to air pollution only \nhuman health Impacts were considered as they contribute to 95% of total impact from air pollution. Land use valuation was based on net change in economic value due to loss of ecosystem service and was calculated only for the electricity procured from the grid mix, since for the direct operations, land use change is not considered to be material. For calculating impact due to water consumption, the following factors were taken into consideration \u2013 impact on human health, incidence of infectious disease and impact of energy consumption. \nIn FY2021, the total environmental costs related to \nWipro\u2019s operations and supply chain were quantified at $0.20 billion ($0.23 billion in FY20), of which operational and supply chain impacts contribute 8% ($16.3 million) and 92% ($187 million) respectively. Of the operational impacts, the highest contribution is from electricity consumption at 80% ($12.8 million). Within Wipro\u2019s upstream supply chain, purchased goods and services across all tiers of suppliers (88%; $161 million) and fuel and energy related activities (12%; $22 million) are the top two impact categories.  In terms of the sources of impact, air pollution (57%; $117.6 million), greenhouse gas emissions (30%; $60 million) are the top two contributors.\n79\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3151, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1e16e088-2d8d-44a4-b4e4-56482e285e4a": {"__data__": {"id_": "1e16e088-2d8d-44a4-b4e4-56482e285e4a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b1855959-9d61-457f-a7f1-a6e2a2b06e1d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "71f25048880b7ae19ef7ca458cf44240e2be02ee7f957f0776ddbc1b12a66801", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "56ce9af3-34bc-4a05-8227-44838a908899", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "b78f1ad22aa8584eb3bafe3f5d7cf6388bb96af7216edca8115ca9706e1fad7f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5b325095-d653-4117-9b35-55303c9830b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "a2161225bde7594506cbc887723544fc5eddda485633041a9787603848e60cb6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Human Capital\nThe New Normal\nSince March 2020, 95% of our workforce has been \nworking from home due to the global COVID-19 pandemic.

Our focus now is to create hybrid ways of working to ensure employee wellbeing as well as business continuity.\nCulture Transformation and \nInclusion & Diversity\nCulture / Values\nSince our founding in 1945, Wipro has been driven \nby the belief that purpose fuels business and vice versa. Our Founder Chairman Azim Premji led the way for Wipro being an organization known for its moral compass and an unflinching commitment to values. This has helped us foster a more inclusive workplace for employees, vendors and clients alike. While our company has transformed many times over the years, the Spirit of Wipro, our core values, has remained constant. Chairman Rishad Premji, introduced the Five Habits essential to drive a Growth Mindset in early 2020, which are our values in action. The Five Habits are more relevant than ever before in light of the ongoing pandemic as it asks each of us to be reflective, supportive, and collaborative. So far, over 21,000 leaders globally have been part of 75 immersive and interactive sessions on the Five Habits. The Five Habits can transform how we all experience Wipro as each Wiproite is a visible example of the organization culture.\nInclusion and Diversity (I&D)\nInclusion and Diversity remains at the core of Wipro. We are committed to creating and nurturing a sense of belonging through equitable practices and by embracing all forms of differences. We renewed our I&D strategy and rearticulated our I&D policy. While we continue to have a structured approach for Gender, Disability, LGBTQ+, Race and Ethnicity inclusion, our journey involves embracing other forms of diversities including generational/ nationality/ supplier diversity, among others. We remain focused on encouraging plurality of ideas and elimination of unconscious bias. The I&D council was constituted in 2018 continues to provide direction and strategic guidance to the charter. The council is sponsored by the CEO and chaired by the Global I&D Head and consists of diverse leaders across businesses. Further, Business Unit and geography specific I&D councils drive the organizational and unit charter, led by a senior business leader from the unit or geography. They are supported by a network of Inclusion Champs.\nPeople Processes: Key Highlights FY 2020-21 \nHiring and Onboarding\nAs part of our Digitalization initiatives, we had invested in transforming our hiring and on-boarding processes for a more seamless and automated experience. These initiatives helped us navigate the pandemic effectively. Our entire hiring process was touchless and remote. We organized virtual walk-ins and leveraged digital technologies to connect and engage with candidates. Post selection, the offer roll-out process, document collection and verification as well as onboarding were done remotely. New employees were onboarded via virtual sessions. They were enabled to be productive from the first day as we provided them with the necessary infrastructure in a work from home situation. Our strategy of localization continued to gain momentum with an increased number of local candidates in all the geographies that we operate in.\n81\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3485, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d818f48-5088-4768-9538-c7bc43a98f71": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d818f48-5088-4768-9538-c7bc43a98f71", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "48035a12-1637-416e-9284-3f5cfd93ee8c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e48a11d5e0b7a52fc14e6a5b96d0b8395590ea551be2c0a04ba5692472bd83f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5b325095-d653-4117-9b35-55303c9830b7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "13b632910a3d7d1d9c2f8807da7d743b9b2473c77cf2304130ce0f9f58611216", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9a512d3d-f2cc-4ca0-b11b-8c19b6ff7573", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04f2438e64ca8dded2fc8089ea04a7a918f615b9c93f36ef2ba71bbf5d42ef37", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Performance and Talent \nManagement\nThe talent management processes contribute \nto the strategic priorities of Wipro by driving high performance across the organization. Our talent differentiation is sharp and is based on outcomes. Rewards are closely linked to performance outcomes. Career growth is based on sustained high performance. We believe values and performance must go hand in hand. Our quarterly review process continues to be a strong platform to encourage candid, constructive and meaningful feedforward discussions between employees and managers. Our performance management system leverages Artificial Intelligence to aid employees and managers in writing effective reviews thereby nudging and training them while they submit reviews quarter on quarter. There is an annual 360-degree feedback survey where employees in middle and senior level roles receive feedback from their teams, peers, internal customers, managers, external customers. At Wipro, succession planning is an annual exercise. Talent is classified in terms of performance and potential; successors are identified for critical roles and development actions are framed. Executive coaching is provided to senior leadership to facilitate their all-round development. Career building is an important pillar of our employee value proposition and in line with that the promotion and rotation policies have been strengthened to ensure more employees can take up internal roles and build a career that they  aspire for.Learning and Development\nWe continue to make significant investments in our learning & development function towards building a resilient organization, focused on business imperatives in the new normal. Our comprehensive efforts in digitalizing offerings and completely moving our curriculum online, have enabled employees to effectively manage the transition to a virtual work environment. We have been able to engage employees, ensure their wellbeing and cater to diverse learner needs through Virtual Instructor Led Trainings (VILTs), self-paced modules, virtual learning journeys, social learning, virtual mentoring, gamified interventions and e-summits. With the change in the ways of working due to COVID-19, we created six e-learning modules on Work From Home (WFH) readiness, work etiquette, managing stress in times of crisis, staying positive in trying times, leading in a crisis situation and empathy in difficult times.\nHuman Capital\n82\nBuilding a Bold Tomorrow", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2463, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9a512d3d-f2cc-4ca0-b11b-8c19b6ff7573": {"__data__": {"id_": "9a512d3d-f2cc-4ca0-b11b-8c19b6ff7573", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "450d6bf4-95d5-40ab-8360-b5dd3f09667a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "61d4456cb15cb7211787cc5f5a74c3bb38d6aa2fa03276b5b6642618897f0c38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9d818f48-5088-4768-9538-c7bc43a98f71", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "53", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e48a11d5e0b7a52fc14e6a5b96d0b8395590ea551be2c0a04ba5692472bd83f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "39206f03-f9e7-432f-8afe-88210ab0dde7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "03cad61cd0f96abf31470398a418e9eba5c212d0487f5dd4c1d4c402e80183d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Employee Wellbeing\nWith the ongoing pandemic, employee wellbeing \nhas become an area of strategic focus for Wipro. Our employee wellness programs encompass the three areas of employee wellbeing, namely physical, emotional and financial wellbeing.\nPhysical Wellbeing\nWipro provides a safe and healthy workplace for all employees. Our key focus areas to enhance the physical wellbeing of our employees are Health and Safety Risk Assessment, all round safety and security measures, including training and sensitization to meet the standard competence required by law in performing one's duties. All campuses maintain a conducive work environment in line with Indian/International standards. A Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) license is mandatory for vendors operating within Wipro owned locations in India. All our facilities have safety committees, which meet quarterly and participate in risk assessments, safety inspections, incident investigations and hygiene audits. During 2020-21, more than 8,400 permanent and contract employees, were part of awareness camps and programmes. Awareness sessions were also conducted regarding off-the-job safety and road safety. More than 8,000 permanent and contract employees participated in committees on safety, food, transport, etc. across India, to represent the interests of the workforce.\nEmotional Wellbeing\nIn the new normal, to ensure the emotional and mental wellbeing of our employees, we have partnered with leading global EAP providers across the globe. It enables employees to reach out to counsellors 24x7 in-person and/or on phone to seek assistance for issues pertaining to personal or professional life. We conducted multiple sessions across geographies on topics including COVID-19, Work from Home and Emotional Wellbeing to enable employees cope with the new ways of working and remain emotionally strong. Key policy changes this year included changes in medical assistance, insurance and leaves.COVID-19- Business Continuity \nProcess\nThe exceptional circumstances around COVID-19 \nhave brought to light emerging risks and have made previously identified risks more critical. We identified business critical functions, equipment and employees, and also determined how, where and by whom critical services would be provided. We suspended non-essential work to reduce risk of exposure to the virus and maintained social distancing norms. We carefully monitored employee availability, health and safety. Business continuity plans were put in place to maintain seamless operations. We analyzed and assessed supply chains to identify risks which exist in our operations. Wipro also mobilized infrastructure to support remote working, to ensure employees have the necessary hardware, software, equipment and internet connectivity to work safely and efficiently from home. A real time communication plan was put in place to keep employees updated at all times. \n83\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2978, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "39206f03-f9e7-432f-8afe-88210ab0dde7": {"__data__": {"id_": "39206f03-f9e7-432f-8afe-88210ab0dde7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "456c2706-dd82-44c2-b1e6-b070f4cab30d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "55", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e7b68cdec0c5a054ec69f341f4a406a9c04bc7d1f9b584f5a4992be66187814f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9a512d3d-f2cc-4ca0-b11b-8c19b6ff7573", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "54", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "61d4456cb15cb7211787cc5f5a74c3bb38d6aa2fa03276b5b6642618897f0c38", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "85770667-2b7a-43dd-8a22-4be99c2ad885", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "653209dff8660898908ebcfe94e11e393e239b203dd12d5e494267b5d8d8e325", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Employee Experiences, \nEngagement and Communication\nEmployee Communication\nThe COVID-19 pandemic compelled us to reimagine \nhow we engage and communicate globally.

Instead we conducted three short COVID-19 Sentiment Surveys focusing on pillars relevant to employees working from home, such as remote enablement, work life balance and productivity, remote communities, manager and senior leadership effectiveness, physical and mental health and confidence in our future. Over 172,000 employees participated in these surveys, cumulatively. The results of these surveys have been analyzed and the key action areas were to focus more on Mental and Physical Health. We took several policy decisions based on these inputs, detailed in Employee Wellbeing section.\nDigitalization and Talent Analytics\nWe continue to digitalize and transform our internal systems to drive business outcomes and enhance employee experience. Relevant analytics and insights are made available to HR business partners and business to enable decision-making based on data.Financial Wellbeing\nWe continually strive to provide our full-time and part-time employees with compensation packages commensurate with their skills and experience and in accordance with laws of the land. Our benefits program follows an integrated approach and provides a range of options for better financial and social security, including efficient tax-management options, life and accident insurance, medical packages and assistance in managing financial issues. For employees in India, we have organized periodic panel discussions and webinars on importance of insurance and investment awareness. We provide long-term incentives (LTI) by granting restricted stock units (RSUs) and Performance Stock Units (PSUs) to key executives. Our LTI plans are aimed at motivating and retaining key leaders. We continue to drive a high-performance and growth-oriented culture through our variable pay programs.

Providing equal employment opportunity, ensuring distributive, procedural, and interactional fairness, creating a harassment-free, safe environment and respecting fundamental rights are some of the ways in which we ensure the same. As an equal opportunity employer, we do not discriminate on the basis of race, colour, religion, sex, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation or disability status.

They cover all employees, suppliers, clients, communities and countries across geographies where we do business. Wipro is also one of the founding members of CII\u2019s Business for Human Rights Initiative.\nFreedom of Association\nWe respect the right of employees to freely associate without fear of reprisal, discrimination, intimidation or harassment. Our employees are represented by formal employee representative groups in certain geographies including Continental Europe and Latin America which constitute 2.3% of our workforce with a further 1.6% under collective bargaining agreements. Our HR representatives ensure legislative awareness and compliance and meet these groups periodically to inform and consult on any change that can impact their terms and conditions / work environment.Risk Identification Process\nWe have established committees and processes like the Ombuds, Prevention of Sexual Harassment Committee, Employee Experience Survey, Audit/Risk & Compliance committees, EHS, an Inclusion & Diversity Council and Culture council to review progress and formulate strategies to address issues pertaining to compliance, safety and a harassment-free workplace. These processes are periodically reviewed by the top management. We keep our employees informed about these processes regularly through trainings, mailers and internal social media platforms. We have identified the need for a continuing Human Rights due diligence program, which we plan to carry out when the pandemic situation stabilizes. Also, a detailed due diligence is done before each merger or acquisition which outlines compliance and governance risks.\nIdentified Risks \nThrough various projects, audits and feedback we have identified the following as potential risks to Human Rights:\nBenefits and engagement of extended/contract workforce\nUnconscious bias at the workplaceReturning mothers\n85\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3041, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b7740d09-e871-4dd0-9847-f13fe426d9a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "b7740d09-e871-4dd0-9847-f13fe426d9a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "62c01571-1b0e-4417-82bc-5f5aefde2d71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "50a292caa2735d039a41060bb49746fa75e00c3833be2b0eb20338f6b382a184", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "85770667-2b7a-43dd-8a22-4be99c2ad885", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "2318570c28f061cad5d2124c87d67187b53448768b508ba69df27a3e251a9ad6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9dc714b4-2994-4ffb-a861-435d122e5747", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "928421951982569069bcbf00db7c1d029f6852f183302d608f7a73103bb93191", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Initiatives to support our employees\nAt the onset of the pandemic in mid-March last year, \nwe enabled Wiproites globally to Work From Home. Currently, less than 2% of our employees are working from Wipro offices. We are taking additional actions to protect and provide support to our employees and their immediate family members. Some of our key initiatives to support our employees are:\nCOVID-19 Isolation Care Centers\nCreated COVID-19 Isolation Care Centers for our employees and their immediate family members across locations\nMedical Support\nPartnered with major hospitals across India to ensure critically ill employees can access the best medical facilities facilitated through a 24/7 helpline\nWellness platform\nPartnered with a tech-enabled online-to-offline delivery platform specializing in primary care and urgent response services\nVaccination Support\nProviding free vaccines to employees and their immediate family members \nCOVID-19 safety webinar series\nOrganized a series of webinars on COVID-19 safety, vaccination, recovery, and more \nCOVID-19 Support Communication\nContinued to share critical updates with employees regularly through multiple channels. COVID-19 support emergency helpdesk numbers were shared with employees via mailers and SMS for further reinforcementHuman Capital\nMitigation Policies/Processes\nWe have created specific interventions to tackle these issues: \nReturning Mothers\nWe are formulating a comprehensive set of support initiatives across all stages (before, during and post return from maternity) for returning mothers. The key elements include building manager awareness of unconscious bias and effective handling of women employees post return from Maternity Leave. A governance committee to oversee the program deployment and settling in of returning mothers and an ecosystem enablement through policy, process and system interventions have been also suggested.\nContract Employee Engagement\nWe engage contract employees for supporting our projects in India for short-term assignments. The duration of such engagements varies depending upon the project and the role. We ensured insurance coverage for these employees during the COVID-19 pandemic along with complete compliance on processes like internal mandatory trainings (i.e. Information Security, Data Privacy, and Prevention of Sexual Harassment, among others) as well as background verification. The resignation portal for contract employees has been modified to include asset declaration. Processes like reimbursement and invoicing have been digitalized to provide contract employees with a faster and more seamless experience.\nSensitization on Unconscious Bias\nUnder the umbrella of our #BreaktheBias campaign, we have monthly leadership blogs, mailers and a mandatory e-learning module to raise awareness among employees on how they can eliminate biases at the workplace. At present, over 164,000 employees have undertaken the Unconscious Bias E-module and received certification.\n86\nBuilding a Bold Tomorrow", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3012, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9dc714b4-2994-4ffb-a861-435d122e5747": {"__data__": {"id_": "9dc714b4-2994-4ffb-a861-435d122e5747", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9c93a35a-702b-4bb5-9b87-2b35f3cf005e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d87709f5fdde7a5a7e3f473ec0c6faac710d4d19625717a0d21daac3b0c6c11e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b7740d09-e871-4dd0-9847-f13fe426d9a6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "50a292caa2735d039a41060bb49746fa75e00c3833be2b0eb20338f6b382a184", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "508db328-f889-459c-9ef2-1b24313f3cc0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f5dea50a4b33f0289fda38e2648d8874eea36826d4da4bd11d761e8b72e08ccb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Board\u2019s Report \nDear Members,\nOn behalf of the Board of Directors (the \u201c Board\u201d) of the \nCompany, it gives me immense pleasure to present the 75th \nBoard\u2019s Report, along with the Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss \nAccount and Cash Flow Statements, for the financial year \nended March 31, 2021.\nI.

We begin by reiterating that the values of \u2018Spirit of Wipro\u2019 guide \nall our actions and embody the letter and spirit of being a \nresponsible corporate citizen.\nOur vision of \u2018value through values\u2019 drives our goals of (i) \nmaking Wipro a more sustainable business in its operations and value chain as defined broadly by the triple bottom-line \nand ESG frameworks (Environment, Social and Governance) \nand (ii) contributing to a more just, inclusive and sustainable society.\n i. As a first principle, we constantly strengthen the \nalignment of our core business purpose with salient ESG goals in the areas of Energy, Climate Change, Water, Diversity and Inclusion at the workplace and \nHealth and Well-Being of employees. All of this is based \non the bedrock foundation of good governance and ethical conduct. During the year, we made a significant commitment to transforming to a Net Zero Company \nby 2040. Our targets of net zero greenhouse gas \nemissions are based on the globally accepted Science Based Targets Initiative. Our approach prioritizes deep decarbonization of our own operations and value chain while deferring offsets till 2040. This is in line with our \ncore values and we believe we are well positioned to \nmeet our commitments.\n ii. In the larger social sphere, our primary areas of work \nare in Education, Urban Ecology, Primary Health Care, Disaster Response and Public Spaces in cities. A common strand running across our social initiatives \nis a deliberative focus on inclusion and empowerment \nof disadvantaged communities. Our emphasis is on deep, meaningful, long-term work implemented by our carefully identified network of nearly 200 partners in \nIndia and all the major overseas geographies we are \npresent in US, Europe, LATAM and APAC.The year 2020 threw up the biggest challenge humanity \nhas faced for a long time, the Covid-19 pandemic. From the \nvery beginning, it was clear to us that our response had to \nbe commensurate with the severity and scale of the crisis.  \nTogether with Azim Premji Foundation and Wipro Enterprises \nPrivate Limited, we committed ` 11,250 Mn of which our \ncontribution was ` 1,000 Mn. For more than 12 months now, we have been engaged deeply in crafting and executing an \nintegrated response that addresses the deeply intertwined \nhumanitarian and healthcare aspects of the problem. We recognize that the pandemic and its after-effects is going \nto be with us for some time. Keeping this in mind, we have \nensured that a significant part of our support is towards \nstrengthening and augmenting the capacity of the public \nhealth system in India, especially in some of the most \nunderserved areas. Of the several initiatives we supported, \nthere were two outstanding projects that represent our ability \nto respond with agility and innovatively: (a) the first involved \nleveraging the canteen infrastructure in our Bengaluru, Pune and Kolkata facilities to deliver nearly 3 Mn cooked meals \nto vulnerable communities in distress and (b) the second \nproject conceptualised and executed the converting of our \nPune campus to a full-fledged 450 bed Covid hospital that \nhas seen nearly 5,500 patients treated till now.\nWe would like to highlight the fact that our Covid response and \ninvestments were in addition to the regular CSR work, which \nwe continued to support to the fullest extent. Our partners \nadopted a hybrid model of online and field work over the \ncourse of the year adapting dynamically to the situation on \nthe ground. For example, our healthcare partners combined primary healthcare with essential frontline Covid work.\nYou will find a comprehensive articulation of our work in \nthe Annual Report, which is based on the International \nIntegrated Reporting framework of how value is created on \nboth, financial and non-financial capitals and how they feed \nand reinforce each other.\n113\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4093, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b8a2a293-4c5a-4d4b-9fc2-e606450b8933": {"__data__": {"id_": "b8a2a293-4c5a-4d4b-9fc2-e606450b8933", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "db6f9c29-9dd1-4317-a6b1-e4db634739c5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "85", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "55ff81f0df5a9e554d8ea71fad86d64f7ac03b91319e4227de1e3f8c5aa39838", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f4798dff-4f82-4d17-8199-27550f99f718", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "cdb82c855a076388647abe335aef2207a38c6f62ec83406b26bb2c270b5db111", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a87c096e-c94e-4201-b49b-b74294befa63", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9c02c445637bd07ac577d6fe9c79a5dbc6b9b1ff9b40c0fd4f9b3dcf064f0122", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "ANNUAL REPORT ON CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY (CSR) ACTIVITIES FOR FY 2020-21\n1.

WIPRO\u2019S PHILOSOPHY ON CORPORATE \nGOVERNANCE\n Wipr o\u2019s governance framework is driven by the objective \nof enhancing long term stakeholder value without \ncompromising on ethical standards and corporate social responsibilities. Efficient corporate governance \nrequires a clear understanding of the respective \nroles of the Board of Directors (\u201c Board\u201d) and of senior \nmanagement and their relationships with others in the corporate structure. Sincerity, fairness, good citizenship and commitment to compliance are key characteristics that drive relationships of the Board and senior \nmanagement with other stakeholders.\n Corpor ate governance philosophy of Wipro flows from \nthe \u201cSpirit of Wipro\u201d which represents core values by \nwhich policies and practices of the organization are guided. The values encapsulated in the \u201cSpirit of Wipro\u201d \nare:\nUnyielding integrity in \neverything we doBe passionate about \nclients\u2019 successTreat each person with respectBe global \nand \nresponsible\n Whil e our Company has transformed many times over \nthe years, the Spirit of Wipro and our core values, have remained constant. \n Our Chair man introduced the Five Habits essential to \ndrive a Growth Mindset in early 2020, which are our values in action:\n\u2022 Being r espectful\n\u2022 Being r esponsive\n\u2022 A lways communicating\n\u2022 Demons trating stewardship\n\u2022 Buil ding trust\n So f ar, over 21,000 employees globally have been part \nof 75 immersive and interactive sessions hosted by our senior leadership team on the Five Habits.\n Corpor ate governance at Wipro is implemented through \nrobust board governance processes, internal control systems and processes, and strong audit mechanisms. These are articulated through the Company\u2019s Code of \nBusiness Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines \nand charters of various sub-committees of the Board and the Company\u2019s Disclosure Policy. Wipro\u2019s corporate governance practices can be described through the \nfollowing four layers: \na) Go vernance by Shareholders\nb) Go vernance by Board of Directors\nc) Go vernance by Sub-committees of Board, and\nd) Go vernance through management process\n In this r eport, we have provided details on how the \ncorporate governance principles are put in to practice \nwithin Wipro.II. SHAREHOLDERS\n The Companies Act, 2013, Securities and Exchange \nBoard of India (Listing Obligations and Disclosure \nRequirements) Regulations, 2015 ( \u201cListing Regulations\u201d) \nand New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Listed Company \nManual prescribe the governance mechanism by \nshareholders in terms of passing of ordinary and special \nresolutions, voting rights, participation in the corporate actions such as bonus issue, buyback of shares, \ndeclaration of dividend, etc. Your Company follows a \nrobust process to ensure that the shareholders of the Company are well informed of Board decisions both on \nfinancial and non-financial matters and adequate notice \nwith a detailed explanation is sent to the shareholders well in advance to obtain necessary approvals.\nIII.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\nFixed price contracts using the percentage of completion \nmethod - Refer Notes 2 (iii)(a), 3(xiii)B and 22 to the financial \nstatements.\nKey Audit Matter Description\nRevenue from fixed-price contracts, including software \ndevelopment, and integration contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time, is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. \nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the \nCompany to determine the project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required to complete the project. The estimation of total project costs \ninvolves significant judgement and is assessed throughout \nthe period of the contract to reflect any changes based on the latest available information. In addition, provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable \nbased on the estimated project costs.\nWe identified the revenue recognition for fixed price contracts \nwhere the percentage-of-completion method is used as a key \naudit matter because of the significant judgment involved in \nestimating the efforts to complete such contracts. \nThis estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires \nconsideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred \nto-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the \nremaining contract performance obligations over the lives of the contracts.  \nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating \nthe audit evidence supporting the application of the input method used to recognize revenue and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total estimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price \ncontracts.\nHow the Key Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to estimates of efforts to \ncomplete for fixed-price contracts accounted using the percentage-of-completion method included the following, \namong others: \n\u2022\t We tested the effectiveness of controls relating to \n(1) recording of efforts incurred and estimation of \nefforts required to complete the remaining contract \nperformance obligations, and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording and allocation systems, which prevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts incurred. \nStandalone  Financial Statement under Ind AS\n144", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5139, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template":

\nbased on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect \ncurrent and estimated future economic conditions. The Company considered current and anticipated future economic conditions on the basis of the credit reports and \nother related credit information for its customers to estimate \nthe probability of default in future and has taken into account estimates of possible effect from the pandemic relating to COVID-19. \nWe identified allowance for credit losses as a key audit matter \nbecause of the significant judgement involved in calculating \nthe expected credit losses.

These responsibilities include the design, \nimplementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company\u2019s policies, the safeguarding of its \nassets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, \nthe accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.\nAuditor\u2019s Responsibility\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in \naccordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal \nFinancial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the \u201cGuidance Note\u201d) issued by the ICAI and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, \n2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial \ncontrols. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial \nreporting was established and maintained and if such \ncontrols operated effectively in all material respects.\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit \nevidence about the adequacy of the internal financial \ncontrols system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing \nthe risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgement, including the \nassessment of the risks of material misstatement of the \nfinancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company\u2019s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.\nMeaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial \nReporting\nA company\u2019s internal financial control over financial reporting \nis a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A \ncompany's internal financial control over financial reporting \nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in \naccordance with authorisations of management and directors \nof the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls \nover Financial Reporting\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial \ncontrols over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation \nof the internal financial controls over financial reporting \nto future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may  \ndeteriorate.\nOpinion\nIn our opinion, to the best of our information and according \nto the explanations given to us, the Company has, in Annexure \u201cA\u201d to the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report \nStandalone  Financial Statement under Ind AS\n148", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5347, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11dd56fa-2168-469d-95d8-0fc5fdbc8fb4": {"__data__": {"id_": "11dd56fa-2168-469d-95d8-0fc5fdbc8fb4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "42f77b07-720b-4f32-b699-999803d3d211", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "120", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "f8cc7c54c3ded31b44be914b33189e452702a1e09e5cd9713e4e048bcf79303c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "50cd52fb-c396-44ac-b55e-08d19f04c44f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "119", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e14518ddb5cb18e14e1623b7e1d499a65c09a62bf1a24220701cd21addbf44d5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a524a1a2-53e9-4619-8dcd-e450bdf3c2f3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4106aa0a94820f914955f3913e637ea4057e20363b78d1f171720bf7e3a69977", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "all material respects, an adequate internal financial \ncontrols system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating \neffectively as at March 31, 2021, based on, the criteria \nfor internal control over financial reporting established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of \nInternal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued \nby the ICAI.For DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS LLP\nChartered Accountants\nFirm Registration Number: 117366W/W-100018\nVikas Bagaria\nPartner\nMembership number: 60408 \nBengaluru\nJune 9, 2021\nAnnexure \u201cB\u201d to the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report \n(Referred to in paragraph 2 under \u2018Report on Other Legal \nand Regulatory Requirements\u2019 section of our report to the Members of Wipro Limited of even date)\n (i)  In respect of the Company\u2019s fixed assets: \n (a)  The Compan y has maintained proper records \nshowing full particulars, including quantitative \ndetails and situation of fixed assets. \n (b)  The Compan y has a program of verification to \ncover all the items of fixed assets in a phased manner over a period of 3 years which, in our \nopinion, is reasonable having regard to the size \nof the Company and the nature of its assets. \nPursuant to the program, certain fixed assets \nwere physically verified by the management \nduring the year.

The Company\u2019s American \nDepository Shares (\u201cADS\u201d) representing equity shares are also listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nThese standalone financial statements were authorised \nfor issue by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors on June 9, \n2021.\n2. Basis of Preparation of Standalone Financial \nStatements \n(i)  S tatement of compliance and basis of preparation \nThe standalone financial statements have been \nprepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (\u201cInd AS\u201d), the provisions of the Companies \nAct, 2013 (\u201cthe Companies Act\u201d), as applicable and \nguidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (\u201cSEBI\u201d). The Ind AS are prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 3 of the \nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 \nand amendments issued thereafter.\nAccounting policies have been applied consistently \nto all periods presented in these standalone financial statements, except for new accounting standards adopted by the Company.\nThe standalone financial statements correspond to \nthe classification provisions contained in Ind AS 1, \n\u201cPresentation of Financial Statements\u201d . For clarity, various items are aggregated in the statement of profit and loss and balance sheet. These items are disaggregated separately in the notes to the standalone \nfinancial statements, where applicable. \nAll amounts included in the standalone financial \nstatements are reported in millions of Indian rupees (` in millions) except share and per share data, unless \notherwise stated. Due to rounding off, the numbers \npresented throughout the document may not add \nup precisely to the totals and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. Previous year figures have been regrouped/re-arranged, wherever necessary.(ii)  Basis of measurement \nThe standalone financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items, \nwhich have been measured at fair value as required by \nrelevant Ind AS:\na) Deriva tive financial instruments,\nb) Financial ins truments classified as fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss,\nc) The defined benefit liability/(asset) is recognised as \nthe present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets, and\nd) Conting ent consideration\n(iii)  Use of estimates and judgment \nThe preparation of the standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the \napplication of accounting policies and the reported \namounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates. \nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed \non an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are \nrevised and in any future periods affected. In particular, \ninformation about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect \non the amounts recognised in the standalone financial \nstatements are included in the following notes: \na) Revenue recognition: The Company applies \njudgement to determine whether each product or service promised to a customer is capable of \nbeing distinct, and is distinct in the context of \nthe contract, if not, the promised products or services are combined and accounted as a single performance obligation. The Company allocates \nthe arrangement consideration to separately \nidentifiable performance obligation deliverables based on their relative stand-alone selling price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine the stand-alone selling price the Company uses \nexpected cost-plus margin approach in estimating \nthe stand-alone selling price. The Company uses the percentage of completion method using the input (cost expended) method to measure \nprogress towards completion in respect of fixed \nprice contracts.

This method is followed when reasonably dependable estimates \nof the revenues and costs applicable to various \nelements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the future costs to complete include estimates of future labor \ncosts and productivity efficiencies. Because the \nfinancial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts, revenue recognised, profit and timing of revenue for remaining performance \nobligations are subject to revisions as the contract \nprogresses to completion. When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in the period in which the loss becomes probable. \nVolume discounts are recorded as a reduction of \nrevenue. When the amount of discount varies with the levels of revenue, volume discount is recorded based on estimate of future revenue from the customer.\nb) Impairment testing:  Investments in subsidiaries, \ngoodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life recognised on business combination are \ntested for impairment at least annually and when \nevents occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit to which an asset pertains, is less \nthan the carrying value. The Company assesses \nacquired intangible assets with finite useful life for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount \nof an asset or a cash generating unit is higher of \nvalue in use and fair value less cost of disposal. The calculation of value in use of an asset or a cash generating unit involves use of significant estimates \nand assumptions which include turnover, growth \nrates and net margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and market conditions. \nc) Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the Company are India and the United States of America. Significant judgments are involved \nin determining the provision for income taxes \nincluding judgment on whether tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which \ncan only be resolved over extended time periods. \nd) Deferred taxes: Deferred tax is recorded on \ntemporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent \nupon the generation of future taxable profits during \nthe periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company considers expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable \nincome in making this assessment. The amount of \ndeferred tax assets considered realisable, however, could reduce in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period \nare reduced. \ne) Business combinations: In accounting for business \ncombinations, judgment is required in identifying whether an identifiable intangible asset is to be \nrecorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, \nestimating the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (including useful life estimates) and liabilities assumed, and contingent \nconsideration assumed involves management \njudgment. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. \nChanges in these judgments, estimates, and \nassumptions can materially affect the results of operations. \nf) Defined benefit plans and compensated absences:  \nThe cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences and the present value of the defined \nbenefit obligations are based on actuarial valuation \nusing the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in \nthe future. These include the determination of \nthe discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in \nthese assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed \nat each reporting date. \ng) Expected credit losses on financial assets:  The \nimpairment provisions of financial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and \nexpected timing of collection. The Company uses \njudgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs to the expected credit loss calculation based on the Company\u2019s history of \ncollections, customer\u2019s creditworthiness, existing \nmarket conditions as well as forward looking estimates at the end of each reporting period.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5116, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce2c451a-5297-438b-b11f-c2bb60686a44": {"__data__": {"id_": "ce2c451a-5297-438b-b11f-c2bb60686a44", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "70784cef-6905-4404-ab86-d8431a7ff078", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "133", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e979050be997c09186d6b45a20c165b3cdb7ffb5b9603937ff9c3e8e4f321941", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "57763b94-7d81-451c-a840-39207a45b96b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "132", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "7ac36ae2e9f178bef5d0c4c04ab65f8c8e6a69328ed39b9ced56eac517958448", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "861a142f-5771-4775-bee0-0fc7592aec85", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8b74e1674a31f215cd814c0b49fada66482a0e1cb8e5a84b78d7354bbdb34e6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements Standalone  Financial Statement under Ind AS162h) Measurement of fair value of non-marketable \nequity investments: These instruments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently measured at \nfair value. Fair value of investments is determined \nusing the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable companies, such \nas revenue, earnings, comparable performance \nmultiples, recent financial rounds and the level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, \nincluding comparable company sizes, growth rates \nand development stages. The income approach includes the use of discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding \nthe investees\u2019 revenue, costs, and discount rates \nbased on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available historical and forecast data.\ni) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment:  \nThe Company depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over estimated \nuseful lives of the assets. The charge in respect \nof periodic depreciation is derived based on an estimate of an asset\u2019s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. \nThe lives are based on historical experience with \nsimilar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.  \nj) Useful lives of intangible assets : The Company \namortises intangible assets on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets. \nThe useful life is estimated based on a number \nof factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry and \nknown technological advances and the level of \nmaintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\nk) Leases: Ind AS 116 defines a lease term as the  \nnon-cancellable period for which the lessee has the right to use an underlying asset including \noptional periods, when an entity is reasonably \ncertain to exercise an option to extend (or not to terminate) a lease. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an \neconomic incentive for the lessee to exercise the \noption when determining the lease term. The option to extend the lease is included in the lease term, if it is reasonably certain that the lessee would \nexercise the option. The Company reassesses the \noption upon occurrence of either a significant event or change in circumstances that are within the control of the lessee.\nl) Provisions and contingent liabilities: The Company \nestimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is \nprobable that outflow of resources will be required \nto settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n The Compan y uses significant judgement to \ndisclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which \nwill be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events \nwhere it is either not probable that an outflow of \nresources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the standalone financial statements.\nm) Other estimates: The share-based compensation expense is determined based on the Company\u2019s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually \nvest. Fair valuation of derivative hedging \ninstruments designated as cash flow hedges involves significant estimates relating to the occurrence of forecasted transactions.\nn) Uncertainty relating to the global health pandemic on COVID-19: In assessing the recoverability \nof receivables including unbilled receivables, \ncontract assets and contract costs, goodwill, \nintangible assets, and certain investments, the Company has considered internal and external information up to the date of approval of these \nstandalone financial statements including credit \nreports and economic forecasts.

The lease payments are \ndiscounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are \ndiscounted using the incremental borrowing rate \nthat the Company would have to pay to borrow funds, including the consideration of factors such as the nature of the asset and location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as applicable in a \nsimilar economic environment.\nAfter the commencement date, the amount of \nlease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\nThe Company recognises the amount of the re-\nmeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment to \nthe RoU assets. Where the carrying amount of the \nRoU asset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the Company recognises any remaining amount \nof the re-measurement in statement of profit and \nloss.\nLease liability payments are classified as cash \nused in financing activities in the statement of cash flows.\nThe Company as a lessor\nLeases under which the Company is a lessor \nare classified as a finance or operating lease. \nLease contracts where all the risks and rewards \nare substantially transferred to the lessee are classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\nFor leases under which the Company is an \nintermediate lessor, the Company accounts for \nthe head-lease and the sub-lease as two separate \ncontracts. The sub-lease is further classified either as a finance lease or an operating lease by reference to the RoU asset arising from the head-lease.\n(viii) Inventories \nInventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value, including necessary provision for obsolescence. Cost is determined using the weighted average  \nmethod. (ix) Impairment \nA) Financial assets \nThe Company applies the expected credit loss \nmodel for recognising impairment loss on \nfinancial assets measured at amortised cost, \ndebt instruments classified as FVTOCI, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, contract assets, \nfinance lease receivables and other financial assets. Expected credit loss is the difference \nbetween the contractual cash flows and the cash \nflows that the entity expects to receive discounted using the effective interest rate.\nLoss allowances for trade receivables, unbilled \nreceivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables are measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses. Lifetime expected credit loss are the expected credit losses that result from all possible default events over the expected \nlife of a financial instrument. Lifetime expected \ncredit loss is computed based on a provision matrix which takes in to account,risk profiling of customers and historical credit loss experience adjusted for forward looking information. For other financial assets, expected credit loss is measured at the amount equal to twelve months expected credit loss unless there has been a significant increase in credit risk from initial recognition, \nin which case those are measured at lifetime \nexpected credit loss. \nB)  Impairment of Investment in subsidiaries\nThe Company assesses investments in subsidiaries for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the \nrecoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary. \nThe recoverable amount of such investment is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (\u201cFVLCD\u201d) and its value-in-use (\u201c VIU\u201d).

The goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of cash-generating unit or groups of cash-generating units which represent \nthe lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for \ninternal management purposes. \nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash \ngenerating unit is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (\u201c FVLCD\u201d) and its value-in-use \n(\u201cVIU\u201d).

If the recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the \ncash generating unit to which the asset belongs \nis less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Pensions and other post-employment benefits are classified as either \ndefined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. \nUnder a defined contribution plan, the Company\u2019s only obligation is to pay a fixed amount with no obligation to pay further contributions if the fund \ndoes not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee \nbenefits. The related actuarial and investment risks are borne by the employee. The expenditure for defined contribution plans is recognised as an expense during the period when the employee provides service. Under a defined benefit plan, it is the Company\u2019s obligation to provide agreed \nbenefits to the employees. The related actuarial \nand investment risks are borne by the Company. The present value of the defined benefit obligations is calculated by an independent actuary using the \nprojected unit credit method. \nRemeasurements of the defined benefit plans, \ncomprising actuarial gains or losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding interest)are immediately recognised in other comprehensive income, net of taxes and not reclassified to profit or loss in \nsubsequent period. \nNet interest recognised in profit or loss is \ncalculated by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The actual return on the plan assets above or below the discount \nrate is recognised as part of remeasurements \nof the defined benefit plans through other comprehensive income, net of taxes. \nThe Company has the following employee benefit \nplans:\nA\n.  Provident fund\nEmployees receive benefits from a provident \nfund, which is a defined benefit plan. The employer and employees each make periodic \ncontributions to the plan. A portion of the \ncontribution is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the Company while the remainder of the contribution is made to the \ngovernment administered pension fund. The \ncontributions to the trust managed by the Company is accounted for as a defined benefit plan as the Company is liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government \nspecified minimum rates of return. \nB\n.

The employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilised accumulating compensated absences and utilise it in future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination \nof employment. The Company records an obligation \nfor compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The Company recognises accumulated compensated \nabsences based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method.

The expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss with a corresponding increase to the share options outstanding account, a \ncomponent of equity.\nThe equity instruments or cash settled instruments \ngenerally vest in a graded manner over the vesting period. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period of the respective \ntranches of such grants (accelerated amortisation).

Revenue is recognised upon \ntransfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration \nthe Company expects to receive in exchange for those \nproducts or services. To recognise revenues, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) \nidentify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the \nperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price \nto the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) \nrecognise revenues when a performance obligation is satisfied. When there is uncertainty as to collectability, \nrevenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty \nis resolved.\nAt contract inception, the Company assesses its \npromise to transfer products or services to a customer \nto identify separate performance obligations. The \nCompany applies judgement to determine whether \neach product or service promised to a customer is \ncapable of being distinct, and are distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the promised products or services \nare combined and accounted as a single performance \nobligation. The Company allocates the arrangement \nconsideration to separately identifiable performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling \nprice or residual method. Stand-alone selling prices are \ndetermined based on sale prices for the components \nwhen it is regularly sold separately, in cases where the \nCompany is unable to determine the stand-alone selling \nprice the Company uses third-party prices for similar \ndeliverables or the Company uses expected cost-plus \nmargin approach in estimating the stand-alone selling \nprice.For performance obligations where control is transferred \nover time, revenues are recognised by measuring progress towards completion of the performance \nobligation. The selection of the method to measure \nprogress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the promised products or services to be provided.\nThe method for recognising revenues and costs depends \non the nature of the services rendered:\nA.  Time and materials contracts \n R evenues and costs relating to time and materials \ncontracts are recognised as the related services are rendered. \nB.  Fix ed-price contracts \ni)  Fix ed-price development contracts\nRevenues from fixed-price development contracts, including software development, and integration contracts, where the \nperformance obligations are satisfied over \ntime, are recognised using the \u201cpercentage-of-completion\u201d method. The performance obligations are satisfied as and when the \nservices are rendered since the customer \ngenerally obtains control of the work as it progresses. Percentage of completion is determined based on project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated \nproject costs required to complete the \nproject. The cost expended (or input) method has been used to measure progress towards completion as there is a direct \nrelationship between input and productivity. \nIf the Company is not able to reasonably measure the progress of completion, revenue is recognised only to the extent of costs incurred for which recoverability is probable. \nWhen total cost estimates exceed revenues \nin an arrangement, the estimated losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which such losses become \nprobable based on the current contract \nestimates as an onerous contract provision.  \nA contract asset is a right to consideration \nthat is conditional upon factors other than the passage of time.

If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist.\n\uf0d8\t The Company may enter into arrangements \nwith third party suppliers to resell products \nor services.

In \ndoing so, the Company first evaluates whether \nthe Company controls the good or service \nbefore it is transferred to the customer. If Company controls the good or service before \nit is transferred to the customer, Company is \nthe principal; if not, the Company is the agent.\n\uf0d8\t Estimates of transaction price and total costs \nor efforts are continuously monitored over the term of the contract and are recognised in \nnet profit in the period when these estimates \nchange or when the estimates are revised.

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the Company\u2019s procedure for determining the \nrecoverable value of each CGU.\nThe recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on FVLCD. The FVLCD of the CGU is determined based on the \nmarket capitalisation approach, using the turnover and earnings multiples derived from observable market data. The \nfair value measurement is categorised as a level 2 fair value based on the inputs in the valuation techniques used. \nBased on the above testing, no impairment was identified as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 as the recoverable value of the \nCGUs exceeded the carrying value. An analysis of the calculation\u2019s sensitivity to a change in the key parameters (turnover and earnings multiples), did not identify any probable scenarios where the CGU\u2019s recoverable amount

The Company\u2019s long-term debt has been contracted at market rates of interest. Accordingly, the carrying \nvalue of such long-term debt approximates fair value.Further, finance lease receivables are periodically evaluated based \non individual credit worthiness of customers. Based on this evaluation, the Company records allowance for estimated losses on these receivables.

Under the terms of the arrangements, the \nCompany surrenders control over the financial assets and transfer is without recourse. Accordingly, such transfers are \nrecorded as sale of financial assets. Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the \ntime of sale based on the carrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact \nof such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 is not material.\nIn certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse. Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is \nobligated to repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits specified in the agreement with the banks. \nThese are reflected as part of borrowings in the balance sheet.\nFinancial risk management \nMarket Risk Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in \nthe price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest \nrates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market \nrisk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, \npayables and loans and borrowings. \nThe Company\u2019s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating \nactivities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company\u2019s \nearnings and equity to losses. \nRisk Management Procedures The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent \ncontrol over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk \nmanagement objectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities \nof this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency \nexposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.\nForeign currency risk The Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. \nConsequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the \nUnited States and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange \nrate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables \nand foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound \nSterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The \nexchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to \nfluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company\u2019s results \nof operations.\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters foreign currency derivative \ninstruments to mitigate such exposure.

To manage \nthis, the Company periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial condition, current economic trends, forward looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and \nageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. No single customer accounted for more than \n10% of the accounts receivable as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, and revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.\nCounterparty risk \nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market \ncontracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimised by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering \ninto transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. \nExposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews. \nLiquidity risk \nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at \na reasonable price. The Company\u2019s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as \nsettlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. \nManagement monitors the Company\u2019s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts based on the expected cash flows.

Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the \nstatement of profit and loss.\nIn assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the \ndeferred tax asset will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation \nof future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become \ndeductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income \nand tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that \nthe Company will realise the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered \nrealisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward \nperiod are reduced. \nThe Company has recognised deferred tax assets of ` 548 and ` 201 as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 primarily in respect \nof capital loss incurred on account of liquidation of an investment. Management\u2019s projections of future taxable capital \ngain support the assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilise this deferred \ntax asset.\nThe Company calculates its tax liability for domestic taxes after considering MAT. The excess tax paid under MAT \nprovisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward and set-off against future tax liabilities computed \nunder normal tax provisions. The Company is carrying deferred tax asset of ` Nil as at March 31, 2021 relating to MAT.\nA substantial portion of the profits of the Company\u2019s India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits \nattributable to export operations and profits from units established under Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme. \nUnits in designated special economic zones providing service on or after April 1, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction of \n100 percent of profits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of provision \nof services and 50 percent of such profits and gains for a further five years. Certain tax benefits are also available for \na further five years subject to the unit meeting defined conditions. Profits from certain other undertakings are also \neligible for preferential tax treatment. The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal 2034-35.The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of ` 11,458 \nand ` 11,963 for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we \nestimate we would have been required to pay if these incentives had not been available. The per share effect of these tax \nincentives for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was ` 2.03 and ` 2.05, respectively.\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable \ntemporary differences associated with US branch profit tax where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference \ncan be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4473, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "974a652c-d3f0-4a07-aafa-a0f880ddb9e0": {"__data__": {"id_": "974a652c-d3f0-4a07-aafa-a0f880ddb9e0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ca3e225f-bffd-4499-b00c-2bc444d89811", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "24698ee49fcbb879bd30e147b348cf83eec9587c05591aa0c36aa781a34aebfe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "03be178c-6601-44cb-ad12-42089b6f1d44", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "172", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "fc26097d1a8aebd17bbaa4aeea51e6385d58455f6cbc19d69acf68d7f6e67712", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f71194a5-6883-4f5a-943e-29f0bef395ea", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "2122d3b19b0560779321928d0a1ad15659bd98aa8678c420c9915fe418ae1339", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal 2034-35.The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of ` 11,458 \nand ` 11,963 for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we \nestimate we would have been required to pay if these incentives had not been available.

Our \nresponsibilities under those Standards are further \ndescribed in the Auditor\u2019s Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Code \nof Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants \nof India (ICAI) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical \nresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements and \nthe ICAI\u2019s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Consolidated Financial \nStatements. \nKey Audit Matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional \njudgment, were of most significance in our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the \nmatters described below to be the key audit matters to be \ncommunicated in our report.\nFixed price contracts using the percentage of completion \nmethod - Refer Notes 2 (iii)(a), 3(xiv)B and 21 to the financial \nstatements.\nKey Audit Matter Description\nRevenue from fixed-price contracts, including software \ndevelopment, and integration contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over time, is recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. \nUse of the percentage-of-completion method requires the \nCompany to determine the project costs incurred to date \nas a percentage of total estimated project costs required to complete the project. The estimation of total project costs involves significant judgement and is assessed throughout \nthe period of the contract to reflect any changes based on \nthe latest available information. In addition, provisions for estimated losses, if any, on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses become probable based on the estimated project costs.\nWe identified the revenue recognition for fixed price contracts \nwhere the percentage-of-completion method is used as a key \naudit matter because of the significant judgement involved in estimating the efforts to complete such contracts. \nThis estimate has a high inherent uncertainty and requires \nconsideration of progress of the contract, efforts incurred to-date and estimates of efforts required to complete the \nremaining contract performance obligations over the lives of \nthe contracts.\nThis required a high degree of auditor judgment in evaluating \nthe audit evidence supporting the application of the input method used to recognize revenue and a higher extent of audit effort to evaluate the reasonableness of the total \nestimated amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price \ncontracts.\nHow the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to estimates of efforts to \ncomplete for fixed-price contracts accounted using the \npercentage-of-completion method included the following, among others: \n\u2022\tWe tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) \nrecording of efforts incurred and estimation of efforts required to complete the remaining contract performance \n219\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited219", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5235, "text_template":

Description\nThe Company determines the allowance for credit losses \nbased on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Company considered current and anticipated future economic conditions on the basis of the credit reports and \nother related credit information for its customers to estimate \nthe probability of default in future and has taken into account estimates of possible effect from the pandemic relating to COVID-19. \nWe identified allowance for credit losses as a key audit matter \nbecause of the significant judgement involved in calculating \nthe expected credit losses. This required a high degree of \nauditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimate of the expected credit losses.\nHow the Key Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the allowance for credit \nlosses for trade receivables, unbilled receivables and contract assets included the following, among others: \n\u2022\tWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the (1) \ndevelopment of the methodology for the allowance for \ncredit losses, including consideration of the current and \nestimated future economic conditions, (2) completeness and accuracy of information used in the estimation of probability of default, and (3) computation of the \nallowance for credit losses.\n\u2022\tFor a sample of customers we tested the input data such as credit reports and other credit related information \nused in estimating the probability of default by comparing them to external and internal sources of information. \n\u2022\tWe evaluated the incorporation of the applicable assumptions into the estimate of expected credit losses and tested the mathematical accuracy and computation \nof the allowances by using the same input data used by \nthe Company.\n\u2022\tWe evaluated the qualitative adjustment to the historical loss rates, including assessing the basis for the adjustments and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions.\nInformation Other than the Financial Statements and \nAuditor\u2019s Report Thereon\n\u2022\tThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors is responsible for \nthe preparation of the other information.

The address of its registered office is Wipro Limited, Doddakannelli, Sarjapur Road,  \nBengaluru \u2013 560 035, Karnataka, India. The Company has its primary listing with BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. The Company\u2019s American Depository Shares (\u201cADS\u201d) representing equity shares \nare also listed on the New York Stock Exchange. \nThe Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorised these \nconsolidated financial statements for issue on June 9, 2021.\n2.  Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial \nStatements \n(i)  S tatement of compliance and basis of preparation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been \nprepared in compliance with Indian Accounting Standards (\u201cInd AS\u201d), the provisions of the Companies \nAct, 2013 (\u201cthe Companies Act\u201d), as applicable and \nguidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (\u201c SEBI\u201d). The Ind AS are prescribed under \nSection 133 of the Companies Act read with Rule 3 of \nthe Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, \n2015 and amendments issued thereafter.\nAccounting policies have been applied consistently to \nall periods presented in these consolidated financial statements except for new accounting standards adopted by the Company.\nThese consolidated financial statements correspond \nto the classification provisions contained in Ind AS \n1, \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements\u201d . For clarity, various items are aggregated in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and consolidated balance sheet. These items are disaggregated separately in the \nnotes to the consolidated financial statements, where \napplicable. \nAll amounts included in these consolidated financial \nstatements are reported in millions of Indian rupees (` in millions) except share and per share data, unless \notherwise stated. Due to rounding off, the numbers \npresented throughout the document may not add up precisely to the totals and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. Previous year figures have been regrouped/re-arranged, wherever necessary.\n(ii)  Basis of measurement \nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items \nwhich have been measured at fair value as required by \nrelevant Ind AS: \na. Deriva tive financial instruments; \nb. Financial ins truments classified as fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss;\nc. The de fined benefit liability/(asset) is recognised \nas the present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets; and \nd. Conting ent consideration.\n (iii)  Use of estimates and judgment \nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and \nassumptions that affect the application of accounting \npolicies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nEstimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed \non an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, \ninformation about significant areas of estimation, \nuncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated \nfinancial statements are included in the following notes:\na) R evenue recognition: The Company applies \njudgement to determine whether each product \nor service promised to a customer is capable of \nbeing distinct, and is distinct in the context of \nthe contract, if not, the promised products or services are combined and accounted as a single performance obligation. The Company allocates \nthe arrangement consideration to separately identifiable performance obligation deliverables \nbased on their relative stand-alone selling price. In cases where the Company is unable to determine \nthe stand-alone selling price the Company uses \nexpected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the stand-alone selling price.

Percentage of completion method accounting relies on estimates of total expected \ncontract revenue and costs. This method is \nfollowed when reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors \nthat are reviewed in estimating the future costs \nto complete include estimates of future labor costs and productivity efficiencies. Because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the \nterm of these contracts, revenue recognised, profit \nand timing of revenue for remaining performance obligations are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. When estimates indicate \nthat a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for \nin the period in which the loss becomes probable. Volume discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. When the amount of discount varies with the levels of revenue, volume discount is recorded \nbased on estimate of future revenue from the \ncustomer.\nb) Impairment testing:  Goodwill and intangible assets \nwith indefinite useful life recognised on business combination are tested for impairment at least \nannually and when events occur or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit to which an asset pertains, is less than the carrying \nvalue. The Company assesses acquired intangible \nassets with finite useful life for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount of an asset \nor a cash generating unit is higher of value-in-use \nand fair value less cost of disposal. The calculation of value-in-use of an asset or a cash generating unit involves use of significant estimates and \nassumptions which include turnover, growth rates \nand net margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and market conditions.\nc) Income tax es: The major tax jurisdictions for \nthe Company are India and the United States of America. Significant judgments are involved \nin determining the provision for income taxes \nincluding judgment on whether tax positions are probable of being sustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which \ncan only be resolved over extended time periods. d) Deferred tax es: Deferred tax is recorded on \ntemporary differences between the tax bases of \nassets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. The ultimate \nrealisation of deferred tax assets is dependent \nupon the generation of future taxable profits during \nthe periods in which those temporary differences \nand tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. \nThe Company considers expected reversal of \ndeferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of \ndeferred tax assets considered realisable, however, \ncould reduce in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced. \ne) Business combinations:  In accounting for business \ncombinations, judgment is required in identifying whether an identifiable intangible asset is to be \nrecorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, \nestimating the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (including useful life \nestimates), liabilities assumed, and contingent \nconsideration assumed involves management \njudgment. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that \nhave been deemed reasonable by management. \nChanges in these judgments, estimates, and assumptions can materially affect the results of \noperations. \nf) Defined benefit plans and compensated absences:  \nThe cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences and the present value of the defined \nbenefit obligations are based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. An actuarial \nvaluation involves making various assumptions \nthat may differ from actual developments in \nthe future. These include the determination of \nthe discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates.

Fair value of investments is determined \nusing the market and income approaches. The \nmarket approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable companies, such as revenue, earnings, comparable performance \nmultiples, recent financial rounds and the level \nof marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on a number of factors, including comparable company sizes, growth rates, \nand development stages. The income approach \nincludes the use of discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding the investees\u2019 revenue, costs, and discount rates \nbased on the risk profile of comparable companies. \nEstimates of revenue and costs are developed using available historical and forecast data.\ni) Useful lives of property , plant and equipment:  \nThe Company depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over estimated \nuseful lives of the assets. The charge in respect \nof periodic depreciation is derived based on an estimate of an asset\u2019s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. \nThe lives are based on historical experience with \nsimilar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\nj) Useful lives of intangible assets:  The Company \namortises intangible assets on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets. \nThe useful life is estimated based on a number \nof factors including the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry and \nknown technological advances and the level of \nmaintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\nk) Leases:  Ind AS 116 defines a lease term as the  \nnon-cancellable period for which the lessee has the right to use an underlying asset including \noptional periods, when an entity is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend (or not to terminate) a lease. The Company considers all \nrelevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise the option when determining the lease term. The \noption to extend lease is included in the lease term, \nif it is reasonably certain that the lessee would exercise the option. The Company reassesses the option upon occurrence of either a significant event or change in circumstances that are within \nthe control of the lessee.\nl) Provisions and contingent liabilities : The Company \nestimates the provisions that have present \nobligations as a result of past events, and it is \nprobable that outflow of resources will be required \nto settle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n The Compan y uses significant judgement to \ndisclose contingent liabilities. Contingent liabilities are disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which \nwill be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-\noccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company or a present obligation that arises from past events \nwhere it is either not probable that an outflow of \nresources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made. Contingent assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the financial statements.\nm) Other estimates:  The share-based compensation \nexpense is determined based on the Company\u2019s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually \nvest.

Significant Accounting Policies \n(i)  Basis of consolidation \nSubsidiaries and controlled trusts\nThe Company determines the basis of control in line \nwith the requirements of Ind AS 110, Consolidated \nFinancial Statements. Subsidiaries and controlled trusts are entities controlled by the Group. The Group \ncontrols an entity when the parent has power over the \nentity, it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability \nto affect those returns through its power over the entity. \nThe financial statements of subsidiaries and controlled \ntrusts are included in the consolidated financial \nstatements from the date on which control commences \nuntil the date on which control ceases.\nAll intra-Group balances, transactions, income and \nexpenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. \nNon-controlling interest\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding \ngoodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are identified \nseparately from the Company\u2019s equity. The interest of \nnon-controlling shareholders may be initially measured \neither at fair value or at the non-controlling interest\u2019s proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree\u2019s \nidentifiable net assets. The choice of measurement \nbasis is made on an acquisition to acquisition basis. \nSubsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount \nof non-controlling interest is the amount of those \ninterests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling \ninterest\u2019s share of subsequent changes in equity. Total \ncomprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling \ninterests even if it results in the non-controlling interest having a deficit balance. Investments accounted for using the equity method\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method \nare entities in respect of which, the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial \nand operating policies. Generally, a Company has \na significant influence if it holds between 20 and 50 percent of the voting power of another entity. Investments in such entities are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The \ncarrying amount of investment is increased/ decreased \nto recognise investors share of profit or loss of the investee after the acquisition date.\nNon-current assets and disposal groups held for sale\nAssets and liabilities of disposal groups that are \navailable for immediate sale and where the sale is highly probable of being completed within one year from \nthe date of classification are considered and classified \nas assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of \ncarrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n(ii)  Functional and presentation currency \nItems included in the financial statements of each \nof the Company\u2019s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which \nthese entities operate (i.e. the \u201cfunctional currency\u201d). \nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company. \n(iii)  Foreign currency transactions and translation \na)  T ransactions and balances \nTransactions in foreign currency are translated into the respective functional currencies using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the \ntransaction.

The Company enters into derivative financial instruments where the counterparty is primarily a bank. \nDerivatives are recognised and measured at \nfair value. Attributable transaction costs are \nrecognised in consolidated statement of profit and \nloss as cost. \nSubsequent to initial recognition, derivative \nfinancial instruments are measured as described \nbelow: \na.

The actual return on the plan assets above \nor below the discount rate, is recognised as part of remeasurements of the defined benefit plans through other comprehensive income, net of taxes. \nThe Company has the following employee benefit plans: \na.  Provident fund \nEmployees receive benefits from a provident fund, \nwhich is a defined benefit plan. The employer and employees each make periodic contributions to \nthe plan. A portion of the contribution is made to \nthe approved provident fund trust managed by the Company while the remainder of the contribution is made to the government administered pension \nfund.

Compensated absences \nThe employees of the Company are entitled to compensated absences. The employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilised accumulating \ncompensated absences and utilise it in future \nperiods or receive cash at retirement or termination of employment. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which \nthe employee renders the services that increases \nthis entitlement. The Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has \naccumulated at the end of the reporting period. The \nCompany recognises accumulated compensated absences based on actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Non-accumulating \ncompensated absences are recognised in the \nperiod in which the absences occur. \n(xii)  Share-based payment transactions \nSelected employees of the Company receive remuneration in the form of equity settled instruments or cash settled instruments, for rendering services \nover a defined vesting period and for Company\u2019s \nperformance-based stock options over the defined period. Equity instruments granted are measured by reference to the fair value of the instrument at the date \nof grant.

The expense is \nrecognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss with a corresponding increase to the share options outstanding account, a component of equity.\nThe equity instruments or cash settled instruments \ngenerally vest in a graded manner over the vesting \nperiod. The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period of the respective tranches of such grants (accelerated amortisation). The stock compensation expense is determined based on \nthe Company\u2019s estimate of equity instruments or cash \nsettled instruments that will eventually vest.\nCash Settled instruments granted are re-measured by \nreference to the fair value at the end of each reporting period and at the time of vesting.

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of control of promised products or services to \ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration \nthe Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. To recognise revenues, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the \nperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine \nthe transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognise revenues when a performance obligation is \nsatisfied. When there is uncertainty as to collectability, \nrevenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\nAt contract inception, the Company assesses its \npromise to transfer products or services to a customer to identify separate performance obligations. The \nCompany applies judgement to determine whether \neach product or service promised to a customer is capable of being distinct, and is distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the promised product or service \nis combined and accounted as a single performance \nobligation. The Company allocates the arrangement consideration to separately identifiable performance obligation based on their relative stand-alone selling price or residual method. Stand-alone selling prices are \ndetermined based on sale prices for the components \nwhen it is regularly sold separately, in cases where the Company is unable to determine the stand-alone selling price the Company uses third-party prices for similar \ndeliverables or the Company uses expected cost-\nplus margin approach in estimating the stand-alone  \nselling price.\nFor performance obligations where control is transferred \nover time, revenues are recognised by measuring \nprogress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and \nis based on the nature of the promised products or \nservices to be provided.\nThe method for recognizing revenues and costs depends \non the nature of the services rendered: \nA.  Time and materials contracts \n R evenues and costs relating to time and material \ncontractsare recognised as the related services \nare rendered. B.  Fix ed-price contracts\ni.  Fix ed-price development contracts \n R evenues from fixed-price development \ncontracts, including software development, \nand integration contracts, where the performance obligations are satisfied over \ntime, are recognised using the \u201cpercentage-\nof-completion\u201d method. The performance obligations are satisfied as and when the services are rendered since the customer \ngenerally obtains control of the work as it \nprogresses. Percentage of completion is determined based on project costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated project costs required to complete the \nproject.

"Derivative instruments (assets and liabilities):   The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various \ncounterparties, primarily banks with investment grade credit ratings. Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market \nobservable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing, swap models and Black Scholes models (for option valuation), using present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying. As at March 31, 2021, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.\nInvestment in commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds:  Fair value of these instruments is derived based on the \nindicative quotes of price and

Accordingly, such transfers are \nrecorded as sale of financial assets. Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the time of sale based on the carrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2021and 2020 is not material.\nIn certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse. Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is \nobligated to repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits specified in the agreement with the banks. These are reflected as part of borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet.\nFinancial risk management \nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in \nthe price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest \nrates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings. \nThe Company\u2019s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating \nactivities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company\u2019s earnings and equity to losses. \nRisk Management Procedures \nThe Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent \ncontrol over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk \nmanagement objectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities \nof this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies. \nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated financial statements under Ind AS\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited\n265", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4050, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2991ad82-3a4f-4024-bb12-282daa1150cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "2991ad82-3a4f-4024-bb12-282daa1150cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "237", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9aed9556-2411-4139-84f7-2251f4186112", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "237", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "8472028a418fa24c2b2bf79136424b8768e6cb98b1d58f84181d8b7e156c5577", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "02deec89-166f-4467-9979-c0a3541f80e5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "236", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d56759cf7686a91090104a469adf003c8b166251d1d777142fe510866d6636ff", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "11aabfe6-934a-4b11-8d21-387018cc5f67", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "741c728f8d8af11e3956b6f64193ca0b8b960ac30ddd646570b7b2f1dda0879d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Foreign currency risk \nThe Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. \nConsequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange rate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables \nand foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound \nSterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company\u2019s results \nof operations.\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters into foreign currency \nderivative instruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including \nthe use of derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency. \nThe Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange \nexposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows. The Company also designates foreign currency borrowings as hedge against respective net investments in foreign operations. \nAs at March 31, 2021, a ` 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the U.S. dollar would result in \napproximately ` 3,095 (consolidated statement of profit and loss ` 1,395 and other comprehensive income ` 1,700) \ndecrease in the fair value, and a

"Interest rate risk \nInterest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate borrowing, including various revolving and other lines of credit. The \nCompany\u2019s investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk. \nThe Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and \nfloating interest rates. Certain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates. If interest rates were to increase \nby 100 bps as onMarch 31, 2021, additional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to \napproximately `829.\nCredit risk \nCredit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage \nthis, the Company periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial \ncondition, current economic trends, forward looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and \nageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, and revenues for the year ended March 31, 2021 and \n2020. There is no significant concentration of credit risk.\nCounterparty risk \nCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market \ncontracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimised by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on \ncredit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis \nincluding financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews. \nLiquidity risk \nLiquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at \na reasonable price. The Company\u2019s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as \nsettlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. \nManagement monitors the Company\u2019s net liquidity position through rolling forecasts based on the expected cash flows. \nAs of March 31, 2021, cash and cash equivalents are held with major banks and financial institutions.\nThe table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of significant financial liabilities at \nthe reporting date. The amounts include estimated interest payments and exclude the impact of netting agreements,  \nif any.\nAs at March 31, 2021\nContractual cash flowsCarrying \nvalueLess than 1 \nyear1-2 years

Contract Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company classifies its right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. \nA receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage \nof time is required before payment of that consideration is due. For example, the Company recognises a receivable for revenues related to time and materials contracts or volume based contracts. The Company presents such receivables as part of unbilled receivables at their net estimated realisable value. The same is tested for impairment as per the guidance in Ind AS 109 using expected credit loss method.\nContract assets: During the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, ` 15,101 and ` 13,068 of contract assets pertaining to \nfixed-price development contracts have been reclassified to receivables on completion of milestones.\nContract liabilities: During the year ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognised revenue of `16,082  \nand ` 21,193 arising from contract liabilities as at March 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\nContract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting \nperiod.\nB. R emaining Performance Obligations\nRevenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognised, which includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognised as revenue in future periods. Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based.\nAs at March 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance \nobligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ` 384,881 and ` 360,033, respectively, of which \napproximately 59% and 62%, respectively, is expected to be recognised as revenues within two years, and the remainder thereafter. This includes contracts with a substantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause by the customer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time of inception. Historically, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.\nC. Disaggregation of R evenue\nThe tables below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment(refer to Note 36 \n\u201cSegment Information\u201d), sector and type of contract.

Deferred tax liability on the intangible assets identified and carry forward losses on acquisitions is recorded by an adjustment \nto goodwill. Other than these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the consolidated \nstatement of profit and loss. \nIn assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the \ndeferred tax asset will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become \ndeductible. The Company considers the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income \nand tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced. \nDeferred tax asset amounting to ` 8,676 and ` 8,124 as at March 31, 2021and 2020, respectively in respect of unused \ntax losses have not been recognised by the Company. The tax loss carry-forwards of ` 31,993 and ` 29,736 as at March \n31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on which deferred tax asset has not been recognized by the Company, because it is \nprobable that future taxable profits will not be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilized in the foreseeable future. Approximately, ` 17,691 and \n` 14,429 as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of these tax \nloss carry-forwards is not currently subject to expiration dates. The remaining tax loss carry-forwards of approximately  \n` 14,302 and ` 15,307 as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, expires in various years through fiscal 2038.\nThe Company has recognised deferred tax assets of ` 1,637 and ` 2,044 primarily in respect of carry forward losses \nincluding certain subsidiaries as at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based \non our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered \nwith the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards \nof the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether the financial statements are free of material \nmisstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether \ndue to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond \nto those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our \naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters \narising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be \ncommunicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate \nto accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to estimates of efforts to \ncomplete for fixed-price contracts accounted using the \npercentage-of-completion method included the following, among others: \n\u2022\tWe tested the effectiveness of controls relating to (1) \nrecording of efforts incurred and estimation of efforts required to complete the remaining contract performance obligations, and (2) access and application controls pertaining to time recording and allocation systems, which \nprevents unauthorised changes to recording of efforts \nincurred. \n\u2022\tWe evaluated management\u2019s ability to reasonably \nestimate the progress towards satisfying the performance \nobligation by comparing actual information to estimates for performance obligations that have been fulfilled.\n\u2022\tWe selected a sample of fixed price contracts with \ncustomers accounted using percentage-of-completion \nmethod and performed the following: \no R ead the contract and based on the terms and \nconditions evaluated whether recognizing revenue over time was appropriate, and the contract was included in management\u2019s calculation of revenue over time.\no E valuated other information that supported the \nestimates of the progress towards satisfying the performance obligation.\no E valuated the appropriateness of and consistency in the \napplication of management\u2019s policies and methodologies to estimate progress towards satisfying the performance obligation.\no Compar ed efforts incurred with Company\u2019s estimate of \nefforts incurred to date to identify significant variations and evaluate whether those variations have been considered appropriately in estimating the remaining \nefforts to complete the contract.\no T ested the estimate for consistency with the status of \ndelivery of milestones and customer acceptances to \nidentify possible delays in achieving milestones, which require changes in estimated efforts to complete the \nremaining performance obligations.\nAllowance for credit losses Refer Notes 2(iv)(g), 3(x)(A), 9 \nand 25 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company determines the allowance for credit losses \nbased on historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current and estimated future economic conditions. The Company considered current and anticipated future \neconomic conditions on the basis of the credit reports and \nother related credit information for its customers to estimate the probability of default in future and has taken into account estimates of possible effect from the pandemic relating to COVID-19. \nWe identified allowance for credit losses as a critical audit \nmatter because of the significant judgment involved in calculating the expected credit losses. This required a high \ndegree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of \neffort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management\u2019s estimate of the expected credit losses.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the allowance for credit \nlosses for trade receivables, unbilled receivables and \ncontract assets included the following, among others: \n\u2022\tWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the (1) \ndevelopment of the methodology for the allowance for credit losses, including consideration of the current and \nestimated future economic conditions, (2) completeness \nand accuracy of information used in the estimation of probability of default, and (3) computation of the allowance for credit losses.\n\u2022\tFor a sample of customers we tested the input data such as credit reports and other credit related information used in estimating the probability of default by comparing them to external and internal sources of information. \n\u2022\tWe evaluated the incorporation of the applicable assumptions into the estimate of expected credit losses and tested the mathematical accuracy and computation of \nthe allowances by using the same input data used by the \nCompany.\n\u2022\tWe evaluated the qualitative adjustment to the historical loss rates, including assessing the basis for the \nadjustments and the reasonableness of the significant \nassumptions.\n/s/ Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP\nBengaluru, India\nJune 9, 2021\nWe have served as the

Basis of preparation of consolidated financial \nstatements \n(i) S tatement of compliance and basis of preparation \n The consolida ted financial statements have been \nprepared in compliance with International Financial \nReporting Standards and its interpretations (\u201c IFRS\u201d), \nas issued by the International Accounting Standards \nBoard (\u201cIASB\u201d). All accounting policies have been \napplied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements, except for new accounting standards adopted by the Company. \n The consolida ted financial statements correspond to \nthe classification provisions contained in IAS 1(revised), \u201cPresentation of Financial Statements\u201d. For clarity, various items are aggregated in the consolidated \nstatement of income, consolidated statement of \ncomprehensive income and consolidated statement of financial position. These items are disaggregated separately in the notes to the consolidated financial \nstatements, where applicable. \n A ll amounts included in the consolidated financial \nstatements are reported in millions of Indian rupees \n(`\u00a0in millions) except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated. Due to rounding off, the numbers \npresented throughout the document may not add \nup precisely to the totals and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. \n(ii) Basis of measurement \n The consolida ted financial statements have been \nprepared on a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items which have been measured at fair value as required by relevant IFRS:\na. Deriva tive financial instruments,\nb. Financial ins truments classified as fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss, \nc. The de fined benefit liability/(asset) is recognized as \nthe present value of defined benefit obligation less fair value of plan assets; and \nd. Conting ent consideration.\n(iii) Convenience translation (unaudited) \n The accompan ying consolidated financial statements \nhave been prepared and reported in Indian rupees, the functional currency of the Parent Company. Solely for the convenience of the readers, the consolidated financial \nstatements as at and for the year ended March 31, \n2021, have been translated into United States dollars at the certified foreign exchange rate of $1 = ` 73.14 \nas published by Federal Reserve Board of Governors \non March 31, 2021. No representation is made that the \nIndian rupee amounts have been, could have been or could be converted into United States dollars at such a rate or any other rate. Due to rounding off, the translated numbers presented throughout the document may not \nadd up precisely to the totals. \n(iv) Use of estimates and judgment \n The pr eparation of the consolidated financial \nstatements in conformity with IFRS requires the \nmanagement to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting \npolicies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, \nincome, and expenses. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n Es timates and underlying assumptions are reviewed \non an ongoing basis. Revision to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, \ninformation about significant areas of estimation, \nuncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial \nstatements are included in the following notes:\na) Revenue recognition:  The Company applies \njudgement to determine whether each product or \nservice promised to a customer is capable of being \ndistinct, and is distinct in the context of the contract, if \nnot, the promised product or service is combined and accounted as a single performance obligation.

In cases where the Company is unable \nto determine the stand-alone selling price the \nCompany uses expected cost-plus margin approach in estimating the stand-alone selling price. The Company uses the percentage of completion of \nmethod using the input (cost expended) method to \nmeasure progress towards completion in respect of fixed price contracts. Percentage of completion method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs. This method \nis followed when reasonably dependable estimates \nof the revenues and costs applicable to various elements of the contract can be made. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the future costs \nto complete include estimates of future labor \ncosts and productivity efficiencies. Because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are assessed continually during the term of these contracts, revenue recognized, profit \nand timing of revenue for remaining performance \nobligations are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion. When estimates indicate that a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for \nin the period in which the loss becomes probable. \nVolume discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. When the amount of discount varies with the levels of revenue, volume discount is recorded based on estimate of future revenue from the \ncustomer. \nb) Impairment testing: Goodwill and intangible assets \nwith indefinite useful life recognized on business \ncombination are tested for impairment at least \nannually and when events occur or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit to which an asset pertain is less than the carrying value. The \nCompany assesses acquired intangible assets with \nfinite useful life for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is \nhigher of value-in-use and fair value less cost of \ndisposal. The calculation of value in use of an asset or a cash generating unit involves use of significant estimates and assumptions which include turnover, \ngrowth rates and net margins used to calculate \nprojected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, future economic and market conditions. \nc)\n Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the \nCompany are India and the United States of America. Significant judgments are involved in determining the provision for income taxes including judgment \non whether tax positions are probable of being \nsustained in tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex issues, which can only be resolved over extended time periods. \nd) Deferred taxes: Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts, at \nthe rates that have been enacted or substantively \nenacted at the reporting date. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable profits during the \nperiods in which those temporary differences and \ntax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company considers expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. The amount of deferred tax \nassets considered realizable, however, could reduce \nin the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced.\ne) Business combinations: In accounting for business combinations, judgment is required in identifying whether an identifiable intangible asset is to be \nrecorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, \nestimating the acquisition date fair value of the identifiable assets acquired (including useful life estimates), liabilities assumed, and contingent \nconsideration assumed involves management \njudgment. These measurements are based on information available at the acquisition date and are based on expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management. Changes \nin these judgments, estimates, and assumptions \ncan materially affect the results of operations. \nf) Defined benefit plans and compensated absences : \nThe cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated absences and the present value of the defined \nbenefit obligations are based on actuarial valuation \nusing the projected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. \nThese include the determination of the discount \nrate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All \nassumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\ng) Expected credit losses on financial assets: The \nimpairment provisions of financial assets are based \non assumptions about risk of default and expected \ntiming of collection.

Fair value of investments is determined \nusing the market and income approaches. The market approach includes the use of financial metrics and ratios of comparable companies, such \nas revenue, earnings, comparable performance \nmultiples, recent financial rounds and the level of marketability of the investments. The selection of comparable companies requires management judgment and is based on number of factors, \nincluding comparable company sizes, growth rates, \nand development stages. The income approach includes the use of discounted cash flow model, which requires significant estimates regarding \nthe investees\u2019 revenue, costs, and discount rates \nbased on the risk profile of comparable companies. Estimates of revenue and costs are developed using available historical and forecast data. \ni) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment:  The \nCompany depreciates property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives \nof the assets. The charge in respect of periodic \ndepreciation is derived based on an estimate of an asset\u2019s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The lives are \nbased on historical experience with similar assets \nas well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technology. The estimated useful life is reviewed at least annually.\nj) Useful lives of intangible assets : The Company \namortizes intangible assets on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful \nlife is estimated based on a number of factors \nincluding the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry and known technological \nadvances and the level of maintenance expenditures \nrequired to obtain the expected future cash flows \nfrom the assets. The estimated useful life is reviewed \nat least annually.\nk)\n  Leases: IFRS 16 defines a lease term as the non-\ncancellable period for which the lessee has the right to use an underlying asset including optional \nperiods, when an entity is reasonably certain to \nexercise an option to extend (or not to terminate) a lease. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the lessee to exercise the option when determining the lease term. The option to extend lease is included \nin the lease term, if it is reasonably certain that the \nlessee would exercise the option. The Company reassesses the option upon occurrence of either a significant event or change in circumstances that are within the control of the lessee.\nl) Provisions and contingent liabilities: The Company estimates the provisions that have present obligations as a result of past events and it is \nprobable that outflow of resources will be required to \nsettle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimates.\n The Compan y uses significant judgement to \ndisclose contingent liabilities.

Significant accounting policies \n(i) Basis of consolidation \n Subsidiaries and controlled trusts\n The Company determines the basis of control in \nline with the requirements of IFRS 10, Consolidated \nFinancial Statements. Subsidiaries and controlled trusts are entities controlled by the Group. The Group \ncontrols an entity when the parent has power over the \nentity, it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. \nThe financial statements of subsidiaries and controlled \ntrusts are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\n A ll intra-Group balances, transactions, income and \nexpenses are eliminated in full on consolidation. \n Non-controlling interest \n Non-contr olling interests in the net assets (excluding \ngoodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Company\u2019s equity. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured \neither at fair value or at the non-controlling interest\u2019s \nproportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition to acquisition basis. \nSubsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount \nof non-controlling interest is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interest\u2019s share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling \ninterests even if it results in the non-controlling interest \nhaving a deficit balance.\n Investments accounted for using the equity method\n In vestments accounted for using the equity method \nare entities in respect of which, the Company has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Generally, a Company has \na significant influence if it holds between 20 and \n50 percent of the voting power of another entity. Investments in such entities are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognized at cost. The \ncarrying amount of investment is increased/ decreased \nto recognize investors share of profit or loss of the investee after the acquisition date.\n Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale\n Asse ts and liabilities of disposal groups that are \navailable for immediate sale and where the sale is highly probable of being completed within one year from the date of classification are considered and classified \nas assets held for sale and liabilities associated with \nassets held for sale. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n(ii) Functional and presentation currency \n It ems included in the financial statements of each \nof the Company\u2019s entities are measured using the \ncurrency of the primary economic environment in which these entities operate (i.e. the \u201cfunctional currency\u201d). \nThese consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the Parent Company.\n(iii) Foreign currency transactions and translation \na) T ransactions and balances \nTransactions in foreign currency are translated into the respective functional currencies using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the \ntransaction. Foreign exchange gains and losses \nresulting from the settlement of such transactions and from translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date of monetary assets \nand liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are \nrecognized in the consolidated statement of income and reported within foreign exchange gains/(losses), net, within results of operating activities except when deferred in other comprehensive income \nas qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying \nnet investment hedges. Gains/(losses), net, relating to translation or settlement of borrowings denominated in foreign currency are reported \nwithin finance expense.

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity \ninstruments issued at the date of exchange by the \nCompany. Identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at fair value at \nthe date of acquisition. Transaction costs incurred in \nconnection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred. \n\u00a0 The cost of an acquisition also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration measured as at the date of acquisition. Any subsequent changes to the fair value of \ncontingent consideration classified as liabilities, other \nthan measurement period adjustments, are recognized in the consolidated statement of income. \nb) Goodwill \n The e xcess of the cost of an acquisition over the \nCompany\u2019s share in the fair value of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable assets and liabilities is recognized as goodwill. If the excess is negative, a bargain purchase \ngain is recognized immediately in the consolidated \nstatement of income. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment (if any).\n Goodwill associa ted with disposal of an operation that \nis part of cash-generating unit is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained, \nunless some other method better reflects the goodwill \nassociated with the operation disposed of. \nc) Intangible assets \n Intangibl e assets acquired separately are measured \nat cost of acquisition. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, \nintangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated \namortization and impairment losses, if any.\n The amor tization of an intangible asset with a finite \nuseful life reflects the manner in which the economic benefit is expected to be generated and is included in selling and marketing expenses in the consolidated \nstatement of income.  The es timated useful life of amortizable intangibles is \nreviewed and where appropriate is adjusted, annually. \nThe estimated useful lives of the amortizable intangible assets for the current and comparative periods are as \nfollows: \u00a0\nCategory Useful\u00a0life \nCustomer-related intangibles 0.75\u00a0to\u00a015\u00a0years\nMarketing-related intangibles 3\u00a0to\u00a010\u00a0years\n(viii) Leases\n On April 1,  2019, the Company adopted IFRS 16 \u201cLeases\u201d , \nwhich applied to all lease contracts outstanding as at \nApril 1, 2019, using modified retrospective method by recording the cumulative effect of initial application as \nan adjustment to opening retained earnings.\n The Company has made use of the following practical \nexpedients available in its transition to IFRS 16: - \na) The Company will not reassess whether a contract \nis or contains a lease. Accordingly, the definition of lease in accordance with IAS 17 and IFRIC-4 will \ncontinue to be applied to lease contracts entered \nby the Company or modified by the Company before April 1, 2019,\nb)\n The Company has applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases of similar assets in similar economic environment.

Such arrangements \nare generally for a fixed period but may have extension \nor termination options. The Company assesses, whether the contract is, or contains, a lease, at its inception. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to \u2013 \n(a) contr ol use of an identified asset,\n(b) ob tain substantially all the economic benefits from \nuse of the identified asset, and\n(c) dir ect the use of the identified asset.\n The Compan y determines the lease term as the non-\ncancellable period of a lease, together with periods covered by an option to extend the lease, where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n The Compan y at the commencement of the lease contract \nrecognizes a RoU asset at cost and corresponding lease liability, except for leases with term of less than twelve months (short-term leases) and low-value assets. For \nthese short-term and low-value leases, the Company \nrecognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n The cos t of the RoU assets comprises the amount \nof the initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease payments made at or before the inception date of the lease plus any initial direct costs, less any lease \nincentives received. Subsequently, the RoU assets are \nmeasured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The RoU assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of RoU assets. The estimated useful lives of RoU assets are determined on the same basis as those of property, plant and equipment.\n  The Compan y applies IAS 36 to determine whether a \nRoU asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the impairment of non-financial assets below.\n F or lease liabilities at the commencement of the lease, \nthe Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. The lease payments are discounted using the \ninterest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily \ndetermined, if that rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are discounted using the incremental borrowing rate that the Company would have to pay to \nborrow funds, including the consideration of factors \nsuch as the nature of the asset and location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as applicable in a similar economic environment. \n A fter the commencement date, the amount of lease \nliabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made.\n The Company recognizes the amount of the re-\nmeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment to the RoU assets. Where the carrying amount of the RoU asset is reduced to zero and there is a further \nreduction in the measurement of the lease liability, the \nCompany recognizes any remaining amount of the re-measurement in consolidated statement of income.\n L ease liability payments are classified as cash used in \nfinancing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.\n The Company as a lessor\n L eases under which the Company is a lessor are classified \nas a finance or operating lease.

Expected credit loss is the \ndifference between the contractual cash flows and the \ncash flows that the entity expects to receive, discounted \nusing the effective interest rate. \n L oss allowances for trade receivables, unbilled \nreceivables, contract assets and finance lease receivables are measured at an amount equal to \nlifetime expected credit loss. Lifetime expected credit \nlosses are the expected credit losses that result from \nall possible default events over the expected life of a \nfinancial instrument. Lifetime expected credit loss is \ncomputed based on a provision matrix which takes in \nto account, risk profiling of customers and historical \ncredit loss experience adjusted for forward looking \ninformation. For other financial assets, expected credit loss is measured at the amount equal to twelve months \nexpected credit loss unless there has been a significant \nincrease in credit risk from initial recognition, in which \ncase those are measured at lifetime expected credit \nloss.\nb) Non-financial assets \n The Compan y assesses long-lived assets such as \nproperty, plant and equipment, RoU assets and acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying \namount of an asset or group of assets may not be \nrecoverable. If any such indication exists, the Company \nestimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group \nof assets. \n Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at \nthe same time and when events occur or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of \nthe cash generating unit is less than its carrying value. \nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the level \nof cash-generating unit or groups of cash -generating \nunits which represents the lowest level at which goodwill \nis monitored for internal management purposes. \n The r ecoverable amount of an asset or cash generating \nunit is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal \n(\u201cFVLCD\u201d) and its value-in-use (\u201c VIU\u201d). The VIU of long-\nlived assets is calculated using projected future cash flows. FVLCD of a cash generating unit is computed \nusing turnover and earnings multiples. If the recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less \nthan its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognized in the consolidated \nstatement of income. If at the reporting date, there is an \nindication that a previously assessed impairment loss \nno longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed \nand the impairment losses previously recognized \nare reversed such that the asset is recognized at its \nrecoverable amount but not exceeding written down \nvalue which would have been reported if the impairment \nlosses had not been recognized initially. An impairment \nin respect of goodwill is not reversed. \n(xi) Employee benefits \n Post-employment and pension plans \n The Gr oup participates in various employee benefit \nplans. Pensions and other post-employment benefits are classified as either defined contribution plans or \ndefined benefit plans. Under a defined contribution \nplan, the Company\u2019s only obligation is to pay a fixed \namount with no obligation to pay further contributions \nif the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all \nemployee benefits. The related actuarial and investment \nrisks are borne by the employee. The expenditure for \ndefined contribution plans is recognized as an expense \nduring the period when the employee provides service. Under a defined benefit plan, it is the Company\u2019s \nobligation to provide agreed benefits to the employees. \nThe related actuarial and investment risks are borne by \nthe Company. The present value of the defined benefit \nobligations is calculated by an independent actuary \nusing the projected unit credit method. \n R emeasurements of the defined benefit plans, \ncomprising actuarial gains or losses, and the return \non plan assets (excluding interest) are immediately \nrecognized in other comprehensive income, net of taxes \nand not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent \nperiod. \n Ne t interest recognized in profit or loss is calculated by \napplying the discount rate used to measure the defined \nbenefit obligation to the net defined benefit liability \nor asset. The actual return on the plan assets above \nor below the discount rate, is recognized as part of \nremeasurements of the defined benefit plans through other comprehensive income, net of taxes.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Consolidated financial statements under IFRS\n330", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5003, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d606634e-7957-478a-a9ad-ee0ee0d11209": {"__data__": {"id_": "d606634e-7957-478a-a9ad-ee0ee0d11209", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e30c1768-db88-406c-a2a4-d0ade43c4532", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "302", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "fee5cee5c4fe14f46a21fe1ad670cc2d991828672fb788158fb4e35fd0b25b58", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8ae37a72-0cee-4477-bace-a55f2d2e44c2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "301", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "9fda19586a3fa7860e1c8eec7b11262f4c203cca9cbf22e33e0809b653a4972c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "66810e95-273f-475f-a6b0-d83d46051345", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "c8534fe494735f6165ae4208d9ad38ffeb9496840871c2b955ff252b7bfac93b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company has the following employee benefit plans: \na. Provident fund\n Empl oyees receive benefits from a provident fund, \nwhich is a defined benefit plan. The employer and \nemployees each make periodic contributions to the plan. A portion of the contribution is made to the approved provident fund trust managed by the Company while the remainder of the contribution \nis made to the government administered pension \nfund. The contributions to the trust managed by the Company is accounted for as a defined benefit plan as the Company is liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government specified minimum rates of return. \nb. Superannuation \n Super annuation plan, a defined contribution scheme \nis administered by third party fund managers. The \nCompany makes annual contributions based on a \nspecified percentage of each eligible employee\u2019s \nsalary. \nc. Gratuity and P ension\n In accordance with the Payment of Gratuity \nAct, 1972, applicable for Indian companies, the Company provides for a lump sum payment to eligible employees, at retirement or termination of employment based on the last drawn salary and years of employment with the Company. The gratuity \nfund is managed by third party fund managers. \n The Company also maintains pension and similar \nplans for employees outside India, based on country \nspecific regulations. These plans are partially funded, and the funds are managed by third party fund managers.

T ermination benefits \n T ermination benefits are expensed when the \nCompany can no longer withdraw the offer of those \nbenefits. \ne. Short-term benefits \n Shor t-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are \nrecorded as expense as the related service is \nprovided.

Compensated absences \n The empl oyees of the Company are entitled to \ncompensated absences. The employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilized accumulating compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash at retirement or termination of employment. The Company records an obligation \nfor compensated absences in the period in which \nthe employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The Company measures the expected cost of compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company expects to pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the end of the reporting period. The Company recognizes accumulated compensated absences based on actuarial valuation using the \nprojected unit credit method. Non-accumulating \ncompensated absences are recognized in the period in which the absences occur. \n(xii) Share-based payment transactions \n Sel ected employees of the Company receive \nremuneration in the form of equity settled instruments or cash settled instruments, for rendering services over a defined vesting period and for Company\u2019s performance-based stock options over the defined period. Equity instruments granted are measured by \nreference to the fair value of the instrument at the date \nof grant. In cases, where equity instruments are granted at a nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on the date of grant approximates the fair value.

The adoption of the new standard has resulted \nin a reduction of \u20b9 2,279 in opening retained earnings, primarily relating to certain contract costs because these do not meet the criteria for recognition as costs to \nfulfil a contract.\n R evenues from customer contracts are considered for \nrecognition and measurement when the contract has \nbeen approved by the parties to the contract, the parties to contract are committed to perform their respective \nobligations under the contract, and the contract \nis legally enforceable. Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to \ncustomers in an amount that reflects the consideration \nthe Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. To recognize revenues, the Company applies the following five step approach: (1) \nidentify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the \nperformance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenues when a performance obligation is \nsatisfied. When there is uncertainty as to collectability, \nrevenue recognition is postponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\n A t contract inception, the Company assesses its \npromise to transfer products or services to a customer to identify separate performance obligations. The Company applies judgement to determine whether \neach product or service promised to a customer is \ncapable of being distinct, and are distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the promised products or services are combined and accounted as a single performance \nobligation. The Company allocates the arrangement \nconsideration to separately identifiable performance obligation based on their relative stand-alone selling price or residual method. Stand-alone selling prices are determined based on sale prices for the components \nwhen it is regularly sold separately, in cases where the \nCompany is unable to determine the stand-alone selling price the Company uses third-party prices for similar deliverables or the Company uses expected cost-plus \nmargin approach in estimating the stand-alone selling \nprice.\n F or performance obligations where control is transferred \nover time, revenues are recognized by measuring progress towards completion of the performance obligation.

The asset so recognized is amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to customer to which the \nasset relates.\n\u2022 The Compan y assesses the timing of the transfer \nof goods or services to the customer as compared \nto the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. As a \npractical expedient, the Company does not assess \nthe existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing \narises for reasons other than the provision of finance \nto either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist.\n\u2022 The Company may enter into arrangements with third \nparty suppliers to resell products or services. In such cases, the Company evaluates whether the Company is the principal (i.e. report revenues on a gross basis) \nor agent (i.e. report revenues on a net basis). In doing \nso, the Company first evaluates whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer.

Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. Dividend income \nis recognized when the right to receive payment is \nestablished. \n(xvii)  Income tax \n Income tax comprises current and deferred tax. \nIncome tax expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of income except to the extent it relates to a business combination, or items directly recognized in \nequity or in other comprehensive income. \na) Current income tax \n Cur rent income tax for the current and prior periods are \nmeasured at the amount expected to be recovered from \nor paid to the taxation authorities based on the taxable income for the period. The tax rates and tax laws used \nto compute the current tax amounts are those that are \nenacted or substantively enacted as at the reporting date and applicable for the period.

agreement between the \nCompany and the counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on a net basis. In the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis \nand hence are not offset.\nFair valueFinancial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance \nlease receivables, employee and other advances, eligible current and non-current assets, loans, borrowings and bank overdrafts, trade payables and accrued expenses, and eligible current liabilities and non-current liabilities.\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, loans, borrowings and bank \noverdrafts, trade payables and accrued expenses, other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their \ncarrying amount largely due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company\u2019s long-term debt has been contracted at market rates of interest. Accordingly, the carrying value of such long-term debt approximates fair value. Further, finance lease receivables are periodically evaluated based on individual credit worthiness of customers. Based \non this evaluation, the Company records allowance for estimated losses on these receivables. As at March 31, 2020 and \n2021, the carrying value of such receivables, net of allowances approximates the fair value.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Consolidated financial statements under IFRS\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited\n351", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3123, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "541a5275-3bcc-4ea4-8597-cafa16b8f5f6": {"__data__": {"id_": "541a5275-3bcc-4ea4-8597-cafa16b8f5f6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "323", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "951050ae-d354-4b74-b221-cfdaea393241", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "323", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "4e1bbc2faf5712641b4422462efe1ff436595e51487cc8ed72098dcb4191c4e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "95f639ab-fce5-4f0b-bbee-7c9cd9bad5f6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "322", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "5285ff3384fac6b6887e2d2429c9aa9df3e948c2876f8fd405de97249be566e0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e39504f2-2854-40ea-83bc-1cae6cfa7d32", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "00d36eaaac1963daf69e79089de3bbb073ac5c42171b54b0ba8420dae57f6d88", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Investments in liquid and short-term mutual funds, which are classified as FVTPL are measured using net asset values \nat the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held.

normal course of business, the Company transfers accounts receivables, unbilled receivables, \nnet investment in finance lease receivables (financial assets) to banks. Under the terms of the arrangements, the Company surrenders control over the financial assets and transfer is without recourse. Accordingly, such transfers are recorded as sale of financial assets. Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the \ntime of sale based on the carrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact \nof such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 is not material.\nIn certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse. Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is \nobligated to repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits specified in the agreement with the banks. These are reflected as part of loans and borrowings in the consolidated statement of financial position.\nFinancial risk management \nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in \nthe price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest \nrates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market \nrisk is attributable to all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and borrowings.\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating \nactivities in foreign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company\u2019s \nearnings and equity to losses.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Consolidated financial statements under IFRS\nIntegrated Annual Report 2020-21Wipro Limited\n355", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3681, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "81e6b87c-5020-4117-a33d-dac40959530e": {"__data__": {"id_": "81e6b87c-5020-4117-a33d-dac40959530e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "327", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0834ad3d-edbc-4db9-9401-ed37d88dedaf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "327", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "a60db45f1278aa1a45fb95be6a9a50c5eacaf58c1dd020adb59d473680357c9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "17a79771-b548-403c-bc73-05ec7334b0bc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "326", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "fe208083d56daa965cc8ed5c58e971fe405fabd0c5c3c157fb6a8ac604031ae2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "732b95ce-087b-4960-8999-3c476b7e0eac", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5ea64262da9cacc394a64ceb52bf690258f3f09cb0210f9d61965f0c60d54b68", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Risk Management Procedures \nThe Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent \ncontrol over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk \nmanagement objectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities \nof this department include management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies. \nForeign currency risk The Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. \nConsequently, the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the \nUnited States and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange \nrate risk primarily arises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans and borrowings. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is in the U.S. Dollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The \nexchange rate between the rupee and these currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to \nfluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the rupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters foreign currency derivative \ninstruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including the use \nof derivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign \ncurrency. \nThe Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange \nexposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows. The Company also designates foreign currency borrowings as hedge against respective net investments in foreign operations.\nAs at March 31, 2021, a \n` 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the U.S. dollar would result in \napproximately ` 3,095 (consolidated statement of income ` 1,395 and other comprehensive income ` 1,700) decrease \nin the fair value, and a ` 1 decrease would result in approximately `2,845 \u00a0(consolidated statement of income ` 1,395 \nand other comprehensive income `1,450) increase in the fair value of foreign currency dollar denominated derivative \ninstruments (forward and option contracts).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2725, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "732b95ce-087b-4960-8999-3c476b7e0eac": {"__data__": {"id_": "732b95ce-087b-4960-8999-3c476b7e0eac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "327", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0834ad3d-edbc-4db9-9401-ed37d88dedaf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "327", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "a60db45f1278aa1a45fb95be6a9a50c5eacaf58c1dd020adb59d473680357c9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "81e6b87c-5020-4117-a33d-dac40959530e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "327", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "a1abe1132b11ca47e38780b80d84378fc78ca0fa71e401fd42c852e5571816ef", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "715e4a55-30ae-4d2e-96e4-077f278cfa0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "8f6249bc1172fb4f939db59fc5dc11e6c1ff40a3691b8b620dcb2829966bd6ed", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange \nexposure of forecasted highly probable cash flows.

Other currencies reflect currencies such as Japanese Yen, Swiss Franc, Saudi Riyal etc.\nAs at March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, every 1% increase/decrease inthe respective foreign currencies compared \nto functional currency of the Company would impact results by approximately `957and `1,525, respectively.\nInterest rate riskInterest rate risk primarily arises from floating rate borrowing, including various revolving and other lines of credit. The \nCompany\u2019s investments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk. \nFrom time to time, the Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, which allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates. Certain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates. If interest rates \nwere to increase by 100 bps as on March 31, 2021, additional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing \nwould amount to approximately `829.\nCredit riskCredit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage \nthis, the Company periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial condition, current economic trends, forward looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and \nageing of accounts receivable. Individual risk limits are set accordingly. No single customer accounted for more than \n10% of the accounts receivable as at March 31, 2020 and 2021, or revenues for the year ended March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. There is no significant concentration of credit risk. \nCounterparty riskCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market \ncontracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities which are at \nleast AA rated in India based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with counterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely monitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The limits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis \nincluding financial statements and capital adequacy ratio reviews. \nLiquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at \na reasonable price.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3864, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "29970827-de93-42ad-8258-3e224d95bf28": {"__data__": {"id_": "29970827-de93-42ad-8258-3e224d95bf28", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "328", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "daffd515-9fda-44df-9ec4-ea09732db6f1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "328", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "6060dc1178c8d9d73c3920508a7a7643b7da5ebe1deef624b2db580183363c44", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "715e4a55-30ae-4d2e-96e4-077f278cfa0c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "328", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "bc5ba63a82eb655d0041b0fe5a94fd033eb7d15244205e31b0e63c753d94fa9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "283f4452-3675-4206-88a8-b1ee4a258696", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "189f2288badf8546a9745c67e732519bce728b2d19e9e7ee8e2a4549e0777a8b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "There is no significant concentration of credit risk. \nCounterparty riskCounterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market \ncontracts and credit risk on cash and time deposits.

The Company \nis not subjected to any externally imposed capital requirements.\n24. Revenue\nA. Contract Assets and Liabilities\n The Compan y classifies its right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. \n A r eceivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage \nof time is required before payment of that consideration is due. For example, the Company recognizes a receivable for \nrevenues related to time and materials contracts or volume based contracts. The Company presents such receivables as part of unbilled receivables at their net estimated realizable value. The same is tested for impairment as per the \nguidance in IFRS 9 using expected credit loss method. \n Contract liabilities: During the year ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the Company recognized revenue of  \n` 21,193 and ` 16,082 arising from contract liabilities as at March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 respectively.\n Contract assets:  During the year ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, ` 13,068 and ` 15,101 of contract assets \npertaining to fixed-price development contracts have been reclassified to receivables on completion of milestones.\n Contr act assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting \nperiod.\nB. Remaining Performance Obligations\n R evenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been \nrecognized, which includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future \nperiods. Applying the practical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date, \nwhich are contracts invoiced on time and material basis and volume based. \n As a t March 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance \nobligations, other than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ` 373,879, ` 360,033 and ` 384,881, respectively \nof which approximately 59%, 62% and 59% respectively is expected to be recognized as revenues within two years, and \nthe remainder thereafter. This includes contracts with asubstantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is \nterminated without cause by the customer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time of \ninception. Historically, customers have not terminated contracts without cause.\nC. Disaggregation of Revenue\n The tabl es below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment (refer to Note 34 \n\u201cSegment Information\u201d), sector and contract-type. The Company believes that the below disaggregation best depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from economic factors.\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  Consolidated financial statements under IFRS\n364", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3859, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5c39e2f7-dadc-418c-ae38-325deb547265": {"__data__": {"id_": "5c39e2f7-dadc-418c-ae38-325deb547265", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "336", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "847f960b-cbf9-4976-a98c-9dd76dce1b35", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "336", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "134bebfff139728e5f5f4300e913658fc8d3d5420f6fb22a71849fe1882a5ddd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cb34d3c3-0f7a-4fbc-944f-631adca6be7b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "335", "file_name": "wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-20-21.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 19018391, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "a6a8da12f6e89fa802f69a01377ecc90b3007e22d5bbc7ed9510988960d05e04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a09072fb-dbc0-4ff9-9f4e-8ea06691c278", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "1c9000546dffcc6e79aafee630616fa23d21a7be97f74cc89d9566181a89cba8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Information on disaggregation of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2019 is as follows:\nIT Services\u00a0IT Products ISRE TotalAmericas 1 Americas 2 Europe APMEA Total\nA.

APMEA consists of Australia and New Zealand, India, Middle East, South East Asia, Japan and Africa.\nThe corresponding information for the year ended March \n31, 2019 and 2020 have been re-stated to give effect to \nthe above changes.\nRevenue from each customer is attributed to the \nrespective SMUs based on the location of the customer\u2019s primary buying center of such services. With respect to certain strategic global customers, revenue may \nbe generated from multiple countries based on such \ncustomer\u2019s buying centers, but the total revenue related to these strategic global customers are attributed to a single SMU based on the geographical location of key \ndecision makers.Prior to the Company\u2019s re-organization of its IT services \nsegment, the IT services segment was organized by seven industry verticals: Banking, Financial Services \nand Insurance (\u201c BFSI\u201d), Health Business unit (\u201c Health \nBU\u201d), Consumer Business unit (\u201cCBU\u201d), Energy, Natural \nResources & Utilities (\u201c ENU\u201d), Manufacturing (\u201cMFG\u201d), \nTechnology (\u201cTECH\u201d) and Communications (\u201cCOMM\u201d).\nOur IT Services segment provides a range of IT and IT \nenabled services which include digital strategy advisory, \ncustomer centric design, technology consulting, IT \nconsulting, custom application design, development, re-engineering and maintenance, systems integration, package implementation, cloud and infrastructure \nservices, business process services, cloud, mobility \nand analytics services, research and development and hardware and software design.\nIT Products: The Company is a value-added reseller \nof security, packaged and SaaS software for leading international brands. In certain total outsourcing \ncontracts of the IT Services segment, the Company \ndelivers hardware, software products and other related deliverables. Revenue relating to these items is reported as revenue from the sale of IT Products.\nISRE: This segmentconsists of IT Services offerings to \nentities and/or departments owned or controlled by \nGovernment of India and/or any State Governments.\nThe Chairman of the Company has been identified \nas the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) as defined by IFRS 8, \u201cOperating Segments\u201d .
