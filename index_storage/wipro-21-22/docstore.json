Congratulations!\nFrom this vantage point, it seems impossible to believe that \nWipro was founded as a tiny oil mill in Amalner, Western India, \nin 1945. No one could have predicted that one day, it would \nmorph into a global technology company with a presence \nacross 66 countries, employing over 240,000 people . I feel \nhumbled by the progress we have made in our 75-plus years, \nbut also immensely proud that we accomplished this while \nremaining completely committed to our values. \n1945 was an extremely difficult year for the world.

The pandemic \nis not yet over. Inflation is soaring. An armed international \nconflict is underway. The global economy is facing an \nuncertain future, and we are staring at a huge climate and \nenergy crisis. \nAnd yet I remain optimistic. Because I believe that grave crises \ncarry within them seeds of great possibilities. The fact that \nwe had a Covid vaccine within a year of the outbreak, and that \ntwo-thirds of the world population has already received at \nleast one dose of the vaccine, is testament to that belief. \nDriven by the pandemic, all of us \u2013individuals, and businesses \n\u2013 have discovered new ways to work together at scale with \ntechnology.

The long-term prospects of \nthe technology services industry look very good. \nWe at Wipro are doing everything we can to seize \nthis moment. \nWipro has witnessed a significant amount of change \nin the last two years. Thierry joined us in July 2020. He \nhas given Wipro a new direction by driving change while \nbuilding on our very strong legacy and core strengths of \nthe organization. \nWe have completely transformed our structure and our \noperating model. We have gone from being industry-\norganized to being market-organized (supported by our \nglobal capability units). We have added new talent across \nthe board, with particular emphasis on women leaders. \nOur leadership team is more diverse now, with a great \ncombination of new and old. We have several new leaders \nwho bring in a new mindset, even as we have nearly half \nthe many leaders in the top 200 mark a decade or more \nin Wipro.\nWe are much more growth-obsessed than before. We are \ndriving deep strategic partnerships with hyperscalers and \nincreasing our focus on large deals. We have invested in a \nChief Growth Office function \u2013 a first for the company \u2013and \nchanged the seniority and maturity of our sales leaders. \nWe have invested significantly in acquisitions either for \ngaining market access or for acquiring new capabilities. \nLast year, we acquired Capco. It has been a tremendous \naddition in the banking and financial space, crossing a \n$1 billion run rate, and allowing us to offer end-to-end \ncapability \u2013 from thinking to designing to building and \nrunning \u2013 to our customers. \nCloud is at the core of most transformation initiatives with \na significant headroom for growth in the coming years. We \nhave long been a cloud services pioneer. We are investing \n$1 billion in Wipro FullStride Cloud Services  over the next \nfew years to deliver an orchestrated transformation that \naccelerates business results for clients.\nWe will continue our investments \u2013 in building capabilities \nand acquiring market leading talent \u2013 in strategic growth \nareas such as cyber, data, AI and our engineering business. \nThe future of technology is exciting and opportunity rich. We \nare accelerating our investments in our Topcoder platform \nand in emerging areas such as Metaverse, Web 3.0, \nRobotics, self-learning AI, and privacy systems. \nWe are very proud of our culture and values. It is a huge \ndifferentiator for us, and it is important that people \nexperience that. We are aware that a significant percentage \nof our recruits in the last 12 months haven\u2019t walked \ninto a Wipro office or engaged with people beyond their \nimmediate project. And while we will continue to work in a hybrid model, we are aware that culture and connectedness \ngrow when people meet each other. \nSo, my focus remains on our people. One of the things we \nare driving is the Five Habits. Our big learning is that people \ndon\u2019t experience our values \u2013 they experience our behaviors, \nthrough which they interpret our values. The Five Habits \ntakes our values closer to our people, as I have discussed \nwith 29,000 Wipro employees over 94 sessions . \nWe at Wipro believe our story is deeply connected to our \ncommunities. 66% of the economic interest in Wipro is \nirrevocably pledged for philanthropy through the efforts of \nAzim Premji Foundation. The Foundation works tirelessly to \ncreate at-scale, institutionalized changes in the quality of \neducation in India as well as in other areas including working \nwith vulnerable groups, health, nutrition, and governance. \nOne of the biggest challenges facing the world today is \nclimate change. While it\u2019s encouraging to see governments, \nbusiness and civil society step up to the challenge, much \nremains to be done. Wipro\u2019s climate change program goes \nback 15 years and has evolved into a mature yet dynamically \nresponsive set of initiatives. In April 2021, we announced our \ngoal of achieving \u2018Net Zero\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions by \n2040 . We have a clear roadmap for the short and medium \nterms with targets of 100% renewable energy and 100% \nelectric mobility by 2030. We were one of the first seven \ncompanies globally to have their Net Zero targets validated \nby Science Based Targets initiative. \nOur business strategy prioritizes reaching our goals in a \nmaximally responsible manner.

While the pandemic affected \neconomies and industries, economies are experiencing a \nstrong but unbalanced recovery. With increased consumer \nspending, the IT industry recorded its highest year-on-\nyear growth ever. The pandemic has rapidly accelerated \ndigital transformation for many organizations and has \nled to the adoption of digital business models driven by \nonline customer service, remote working, supply chain \nreinventions, and automation for operational excellence. \nThis disruption has created space for organizations across \nindustries to drive innovation in services and products \nsuch as telehealth, online shopping experience enhanced \nwith Augmented Reality (AR) / Virtual Reality (VR), digital \npayments, and virtual learning solutions. Consumers are \nmore inclined to use digital services like digital payments, \ndigital shopping (retail, e-commerce and housing sector) \nand digital healthcare. While the IT industry is witnessing \nan unprecedented demand, supply remains constrained \nand talent recruitment and retention continues to be a \nkey concern along with current geo-political situation and \nrising inflation. \nOutlook, opportunities and threats\nCompanies are investing in large and complex cloud \nmigration and transformation programs, creating \nmulti-year opportunities for consulting services and \nimplementation. Due to increased demand for hyper \npersonalized products and services, next generation \ntechnologies such as data and AI , mixed reality, digital \nengineering, blockchain, multi-cloud, cybersecurity, \nedge computing, and 5G is expected to continue to \ngrow exponentially.With accelerated rates of vaccination and reduction in \nmobility restrictions, most economies are expected to \nreach pre-pandemic levels. While consumption demand \nhas improved, the recovery is uneven due to factors \nlike imbalanced labor markets, global supply chain \ndisruptions, geo-political conflicts, inflation, and a \ndearth of talent. The continuous increase in demand for \nskilled talent has been building pressure on IT services \nproviders amidst a significant increase in hiring, salary \nhikes and higher subcontracting costs. While there is no \ndirect impact our business from the ongoing geo-political \nconflict between Russia and Ukraine, we continue to \nmonitor these developments. \nA focus on ESG parameters is emerging as a new \ndifferentiator with the pandemic accelerating its \nadoption across the globe. It has become an important \nconsideration for IT services provider selection. Clients \nexpect providers to not only meet global standards on \nESG, but also help them make progress on their ESG goals \nacross key themes such as climate change, diversity and \ninclusion, corporate governance and cybersecurity.\nAccording to the Strategic Review 2022 published \nby NASSCOM (\u201cthe NASSCOM Report\u201d), the Indian \ntechnology sector is estimated to witness a growth \nof 15.5% to reach approximately $227 billion revenue \nin fiscal year 2022 (excluding e-commerce). Exports \n(including hardware) are estimated to grow at 17 .2% \nto reach approximately $178 billion in fiscal year \n2022 and the domestic sector is forecasted to reach \napproximately $49 billion in fiscal year 2022, growing at \napproximately\u00a010%. \n28\nWipro Limited | Ambitions Realized", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3478, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "27b63261-a7b1-476a-a660-aa4a0adbdaff": {"__data__": {"id_": "27b63261-a7b1-476a-a660-aa4a0adbdaff", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "dd445768-7aa1-4626-ae35-71c13474979b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "12", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "87b4116837303a680efbd0f9e885cd1fc98626aa31c9a2b86a812e72c9016d6a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b3cb18e2-7659-4054-8bd6-58fc77a46641", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "11", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "a92c0290047b3a997ca14df917c1b1ddbf97350ee8bf622ee8fbef2b8f1bf57a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "78351063-ca34-469b-a0b3-5301a31cd528", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5f2bec2ea1058257e38342693cf051f8af87e99a934fd0c6a6799f95a67e8277", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Business overview \nCelebrating over 75 years of innovation, Wipro is \na purpose-driven, global technology services and \nconsulting firm with over 240,000 employees and \nbusiness partners across 66 countries helping our \ncustomers, communities and planet thrive in the \ndigital world. \nWe are recognized globally for our strong commitment \nto sustainability.

We converge \nthese attributes with the context of our \norganization\u2019s core business and value \nchain as well as in relation to emerging \nsocietal issues. Based on these first \nprinciples, we have eight identified \nstakeholder groups. The four extended \nstakeholders are also collectively \ndepicted as Community or Society where \nwe are embedded.\nMateriality\nOur approach to identifying the most material ESG issues \nfor us stems from recognizing the importance of creating \nvalue for all our stakeholders Incorporating the range of \nour stakeholder interests and expectations help provide a \nunbiased view of the most important emerging issues. \nMateriality determination for Wipro is based on a \ncomprehensive process that includes an internal process \ncombined with external benchmarking with peers and \nglobal sustainability standards. This helps us understand \nissues relevant to our stakeholders over short-, medium-, \nand long-terms. A key element at play here is the \nassessment and identification of emergent ESG risks. We \ncombine our internal perspective through our enterprise \nrisk management process, internal audits using disclosure \nframeworks etc. along with an extensive review of external \nanalyses and studies e.g. the WEF Global Risk report. The process we have described above is embedded in \noverarching global standards and principles like GRI \nStandards, the AA 1000 principles of \u2018Stakeholder \nInclusiveness\u2019, \u2018Materiality\u2019 and \u2018Sustainability Context\u2019 and \nSustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB , now part \nof IFRS Foundation). \nWe recognize that the determination of material issues \nfor Wipro and our stakeholders is not static and evolves \ndynamically over time. We take care therefore to integrate \nmultiple determinants that reflect this dynamic - Direct \neconomic impact on our business model, organizational \nvalues, pee norms, stakeholder concerns and emerging \nsocietal challenges.Direct\nExtended\nWe also apply the concept of double materiality in arriving at the priority issues i.e. \u201cThe impacts on us\u201d and the \u201cThe impacts due to us\u201d.

This is primarily \non account of net inflow from loans and borrowings of \n` 68,310\u00a0million, including cash inflow from the Notes. This \nwas partially offset by payment towards lease liabilities of \n` 9,730 million, interim dividend of `  5,467 million and interest \nand finance expenses of `  5,089 million. \nWe maintain a debt/borrowing level that we have established \nthrough consideration of a number of factors including cash \nflow expectations, cash required for operations and investment \nplans. We continually monitor our funding requirements, and \nstrategies are executed to maintain sufficient flexibility to \naccess global funding sources, as needed. \nAs of March 31, 2022, we have deferred certain payroll related \ntax liabilities in certain countries pursuant to COVID-19 relief \nmeasures enacted by the governments of the respective \ncountries. We do not anticipate any liquidity challenges in \npaying these liabilities in the future. \nAs of March 31, 2022, we had contractual commitments of \n` 11,376 million ($149.9 million) related to capital expenditures \non construction or expansion of software development \nfacilities and `  22,767 million ($300.1 million) related to \nother purchase obligations.

We believe that our cash and cash \nequivalents along with cash generated from operations will be \nsufficient to meet our working capital requirements as well as \nrepayment obligations with respect to debt and borrowings. \nOur choices of sources of funding will be driven with the \nobjective of maintaining an optimal capital structure. \nWe will rely on funds generated from operations and external \ndebt to fund potential acquisitions and shareholder returns. We \nexpect that our cash and cash equivalents, investments in liquid \nand short-term mutual funds and the cash flows expected to \nbe generated from our operations in the future will generally be \nsufficient to fund the growth aspirations, as applicable. \nIn the normal course of business, we transfer certain accounts \nreceivables and net investment in finance lease (financial \nassets) to banks on a non-recourse basis. The incremental \nimpact of such transactions on our cash flow and liquidity for \nthe years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022 is not material.

Price earnings ratio is computed as Market share price as on 31st March of respective years by Earnings per share. The increase in PE ratio reflects the share price \nincrease by 43% at year end set off by EPS growth of 17% in FY\u201922\n2.  Return on Networth is computed as Net Profit by average Networth. The increase in the Net income from `  107,946 million in FY\u201921 to  \n` 122,191 million in FY\u201922 has resulted in improvement of Return on Networth.\n3.  Our Free Cash flow is computed as operating cash flow less net capital expenditure. Our operating cash flow was low due to increased working capital \nrequirements during the year ended 31st March, 2022.\n4.

The Company\u2019s policy has been to provide regular, \nstable and consistent distribution of return. The Company\u2019s \npolicy of capital allocation includes payout of minimum 45%-\n50% of net income for period of trailing three year.

The cash dividend paid during the year \nended March 31, 2022 was an interim dividend of `  1 per equity \nshare. Further, the Board at its meetings held on March 25, 2022, \ndeclared an interim dividend of `  5 per equity share, which was \nsubsequently paid on April 19, 2022. The Board recommended \nthe adoption of the interim dividends of `  1 and `  5 per equity \nshare as the final dividend for the year ended March 31, 2022.\n53\nIntegrated Annual Report 2021-22Capital-wise review", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3659, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "41a1854d-898e-4358-b196-f46b7e3f249d": {"__data__": {"id_": "41a1854d-898e-4358-b196-f46b7e3f249d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e21da6e8-7c7d-4cbf-9ea3-9bf03d388f63", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "34", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "bf66f0be53ebe30d04c87e99e9b5390f7491bc4cfff3d9cff6ed417326bd3598", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "47e469d9-d14c-4c9a-90e4-1d18202949b8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "33", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3476278c8f0c3f1c6ee212f611cbb07165cd8822a7a380d86ab3c4b201afbabe", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9492d9dc-795c-4a40-80b8-2dbcb72a7fd8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9ccfe58d89d2a391e622243e2ec3ef152e1aecefba0fda841bbecd1a693257c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Human capital\nCompetitive Markets \nCrowd Sourcing \nDisruptive Technology\nAutomation\nInorganic Growth\nDemand for Skilled \nLabour\nCovid-19 Pandemic\nSeamless Employee \nExperience\nOptimal Resource \nUtilization\nEmpowerment\nGlobalization\nCollaboration &  \nCo-creation\nDiversityHybrid working  \nand Wellness\nEmployee Experience\nHigh Performance \nCulture\nInclusion and DiversityBuilding Capability\nCareer and capability \nbuilding\nCareer reimagined\nCommunication & \nEmployer BrandingDefining new ways of \nworking Hiring and Onboarding\nPerformance & Talent \nManagement\nLearning & Development\nEmployee Well-being\nEmployee Engagement & \nCommunicationBusiness  \nOutlookPeople  \nStrategyPeople  \nProcessesPeople  \nResultsBusiness  \nResultsSpirit of Wipro- Values & Ethics\nHuman Rights & ComplianceFinancial CapitalSocial Capital\nHigh -Trust and High-\nPerformance Culture Intellectual Capital\nNatural CapitalEmployee Engagement & \nRetention\nInclusive and Equitable \nworkplace\nBuilding resilience in the  \nnew normal\nThe COVID-19 crisis has transformed the way businesses \noperate and people connect at work and in life.

While our company \nhas transformed through the years, our core principles, \nthe Wipro Spirit, have stayed unchanged. In early 2020, \nChairman Rishad Premji introduced the Five Habits, which \nare our values in action, to promote a growth mindset. The \nFive Habits are relevant more than ever in today\u2019s situation \nsince they encourage us to be reflective, supportive, \nand collaborative.

We value the great ability and potential of people \nfrom all walks of life and foster a sense of belonging by embracing all forms of diversity through equitable \npractices. Our I&D journey is an ongoing effort and \ninvolves constantly working on various pillars of \ninclusivity. While the Wipro I&D Council, led by the \nCEO, offers strategic direction, the Business Unit and \ngeography specific I&D Councils drive organizational and \nunit charters.

Finally, the percentage \ndrops to single digits for leadership roles. This is a \ncommon challenge across the globe and industries. To \ntackle this challenge, in FY\u201921, we aimed to increase \ngender representation in senior leadership levels to \n20% by 2025. To achieve this goal, we set a yearly target \nof 10% gender diversity by FY\u201922. We defined unit-wise \nDiversity KPIs (Qualitative and Quantitative) for top \nleaders. The progress was continuously tracked through \na monthly and quarterly scorecard published to our CEO \nand the Wipro Executive Committee.

This \nyear, we plan to add a new dimension to the disability \ncharter by embarking on Neurodiversity hiring. We\u2019re \nsetting up the ecosystem to launch a pilot project to hire \ntalented neurodivergent people. Also, we will run another \nbatch of Train-to-Hire to improve the representation of \nemployees with disability. In parallel, we will continue \nstrengthening the Accessibility charter as it reinforces the \ninclusion of our employees with disability.\n55\nIntegrated Annual Report 2021-22Capital-wise review", "start_char_idx": 3645, "end_char_idx": 5304, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "74a10152-565e-43e9-b7ab-7bacfacfb7ac": {"__data__": {"id_": "74a10152-565e-43e9-b7ab-7bacfacfb7ac", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6dde2958-b4d5-4c55-90ed-ed812391fdfb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "36", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "28930a3460cd12aa086658eebe9e23ac15b0b36495f237b23cafc21d9a11504f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "52cac15d-774e-497b-936d-5521ae1f7143", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "35", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "7d538e1237109b888d556044e9694cdf1f0ef8f01b10b21effc24e323313bc32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9e5b462c-9773-4d47-9ea3-36f1637706ba", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "797fd5018764ee2447270b0511d313c9ad4aec83f0e711b35ac561a311e7a357", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "People processes: key highlights \nFY\u201922\nHiring and onboarding\nAn organization is only as good as its people, and we\u2019re making \nsure we bring extraordinary people to Wipro. Propelled by \nthis recruitment philosophy, we hire diverse talent across \nthe organization \u2014 from global early talent programs, to \nexperienced lateral hires, to senior leadership roles. The \npandemic has taught us to work in a remote environment \ndriving our hiring growth and building strong candidate \nexperience. The digitalization drive that started in late 2020, \nhas helped us hire better, faster and leverage technology to \ncollaborate, assess, select and on-board seamlessly. We adopt \na multi-channel recruitment approach which leverages our \ncareers website, social media, employee referral programs, \nadvertisements, job boards, placement consultants, and walk-\nins. We periodically revisit our re-hiring guidelines with a clear \nobjective of making attractive and fair propositions to re-hire \ntop talent, as well as maintain a structured approach towards \ncompensation and band fitment considering their experience in \nWipro, past performance, and experience gained outside Wipro. \nWe do all this while maintaining parity between retained and \nrehired employees. To facilitate employee growth within the \ncompany, new openings are also made available to our existing \nemployees. Through internal mobility and redeployment, we \nopen up a world of opportunities and retain our best talent.\nPerformance and talent management\nIn line with our strategic priorities, our talent management \nprocesses drive high performance across the organization. \nLeaders play a key role in setting ambitious business plans and \nleading their teams to meet those goals. They demonstrate \nhigh accountability towards outcomes for themselves and \ntheir teams. Our talent differentiation is sharp and based on \noutcomes. Performance differentiation is enabled by clear \nrating definitions which demand high performance. Rewards \nare closely linked to performance outcomes. Career growth \nis based on sustained high performance. We believe values \nand performance must go hand in hand. We consider our Five \nHabits as our values in actions. Our quarterly review process \ncontinues to be a strong platform to encourage candid, \nconstructive and meaningful feedforward discussions between \nemployees and managers. During the annual review the \nprocess enables fairness and objectivity by taking into account \nholistic feedback through the analytics on differentiation \nacross diversity.\nThere is an annual 360-degree feedback survey where \nemployees in mid and senior level roles receive feedback \nfrom their teams, peers, internal customers, managers, and \nexternal customers. At Wipro, succession planning is a bi-\nannual exercise. Talent is grouped in terms of performance and potential; successors are identified for critical roles \nand development actions are framed. Executive coaching \nis provided to senior leadership to facilitate their all-round \ndevelopment. The process helps identify top talent across the \norganization, with a clear focus on gender-diverse talent that \nwe can engage and groom to take up leadership roles in the \nfuture. The purpose is to create a robust, future-ready, and \nagile leadership pipeline delivering improved business results. \nCareer building is an important pillar of our employee value \nproposition. Our promotion and rotation policies have been \nstrengthened to ensure more employees can take up internal \nroles and build a career that they aspire for.\nLearning and development\nThe Learning and development function has strategically \naligned itself to Wipro\u2019s vision of a bold and resilient organization \nfocusing on investments that make learning accessible and \nrelevant for all. We\u2019ve built a wide portfolio of offerings through \nVirtual Instructor-Led Trainings (VILTs), self-paced modules, \nvirtual learning journeys, social learning, gamified interventions \nand e-summits to cater to various learning needs. We have \nenabled over 185,000 employees in foundational, intermediate \nand advanced digital skills. We have also created six e-learning \nmodules on Work from Home (WFH) readiness, work etiquette, \nmanaging stress in times of crisis, staying positive in trying \ntimes, leading in a crisis situation and empathy in difficult times. \nOver 1.5 lakh employees across the globe have completed \nthese modules since the start of the Pandemic till March 2022. \nWe have enabled access to Udemy courses to employees by \nprocuring 60,000 licenses. 1,438 first-time people managers \nwent through platform-based learning journeys as they \ntransitioned from individual contributors to people managers. \nOver 8,100 women employees underwent career building and \nleadership programs exclusively tailored for them.

A few that \nwe have recently implemented include integrated energy \nmanagement for a large warehouse company, platform \ntransformation and systems consolidation for a large oil and \ngas company, better user experience for electrical and gas \ninfrastructure monitoring, devices and services for smart \nenergy management by end customers, P2P trading in \nrenewables for energy companies, sustainability reporting \nsystems, full material disclosure portal for large electronics \ncompany and integrated workplace management with a \nglobal industrial supplier.These offerings draw from Wipro\u2019s expertise in cloud, \nsustainable IT, sustainable design, innovation and experience,  \nsustainable finance, engineering, cybersecurity and other \nlines of businesses to offer the type of unified transformation \nthat clients need to achieve their sustainability and Net Zero \ngoals. Our two entities Designit and CAPCO provide design-\nled sustainability consulting across sectors and sustainable \nfinance solutions for financial sector clients respectively. \nTechnology partnerships are a key enabler, and Wipro\u2019s \nalliances with many of the world\u2019s leading enterprise software \nproviders, cloud computing, and technology companies allow \nus to create unique and comprehensive solutions for our \nclients.  \nFor more information , refer to  \nhttps://www.wipro.com/sustainability/\nWe have 120+ customers who are part of independent raters \nlike CDP Supply Chain, Ecovadis and industry-led consortiums \nthat assess company\u2019s performance on sustainability related \naspects, which include human rights, environment, supply \nchain, labor practices, etc. \nOpen Source\nDeveloping, using and contributing to open-source software \nis a proven sustainable approach to software development. \nOpen source is present in 96% of all software used today, and \nall global enterprises use open source one way or another. We \nestimate that at least 50% of all Wipro projects/engagements \nhave some element of open-source components in them. \nOpen source enhances innovation, delivers higher quality \nsoftware and is an efficient way to attract and retain talent. \nWhen an organization uses and contributes back to the open-\nsource software they use enhances the ecosystem which \nbenefits all who are involved. This model of collaboration is \nthe most efficient and effective way of developing software. \nOrganizations like the Red Cross, UNESCO, WHO and the \nEU have designated open source as a strategic technology \nand as a way to bring knowledge and skills to all countries \nand citizens. The United Nations has specifically called out \nopen source as a way to make information more broadly \navailable in developing countries and meet Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.\nEngagement in the The open-source ecosystem\u2014from key \nindustry foundations and corporate-sponsored communities, \nto individual, unaffiliated projects\u2014is an important strategic \nactivity for Wipro. Through consistent engagement, we upskill \nour developer resources, drive and collaborate on shared \ninternal and external innovation, and further strengthen \nWipro\u2019s brand as an industry thought leader. Our engagement \nis, and will always be, respectful, collaborative, and \nfocused on supporting the long-term viability of the open-\nsource ecosystem. \n66\nWipro Limited | Ambitions Realized", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5073, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "729c0b49-47ad-4ac3-a89f-e870f63c9533": {"__data__": {"id_": "729c0b49-47ad-4ac3-a89f-e870f63c9533", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "04b7c8fd-8b7e-489b-88da-c2983652b764", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "47", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e1e2daee67eb565c0736cf2175a72c4fb8a77d0c7d83e91e1d3e4aff07e9fe6e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cae8b5f2-6153-4c06-88b6-f0d23290729b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e3de598f7eb7517cab058502de2a81d8daaf0e21afc765e6e42188d9e670fa2d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d531b068-2037-44b5-a5f6-36c415317547", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "30116b74c9f6d09471db7fe42623be608772369992d6ba291dc7768f63ce8a62", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "IT security and data privacy\nWipro\u2019s IT infrastructure is certified under the ISO 27001 \nstandard which provides assurance in the areas of \ninformation security, physical security and business \ncontinuity.

It is our conviction that the engagement \nwith social issues must be deep, meaningful, and \nformed on the bedrock of long-term commitment. \nThis is the only way by which real change can \nhappen on the ground. It is also reflective of \nthe fact that such an approach serves both \nenlightened business interest and social good. \nWe have committed ourselves to an approach \nthat is focused on bringing change inside out \nat four different levels: 1) Fulfilling basic duties \nand obligations, and practicing high levels of \ncorporate governance and transparency; 2) \nProactive approach in leading initiatives inside \nthe organization that demonstrate commitment \nto a humane, sensitive and sustainable world; \n3) Engaging with and contributing to relevant \nneighborhood community issues and initiatives \nin all regions and countries; 4) Using the power \nof communication and advocacy to influence the \nlarger society. \nThe central tenet of our approach has been \nan emphasis on strong, meaningful work on \nsystemic social issues. Our CSR (Corporate Social \nResponsibility) policy  reflects principles and \nstrategies that have informed our long history of \ncorporate citizenship and social responsibility. \nWipro Foundation represents the Corporate Social \nResponsibility (CSR) initiatives of Wipro Limited. \nGoing back over two decades, we focus on social \ninitiatives in Education, Healthcare, Ecology, \nDisaster Response and Cities & Public Spaces. \nAreas of intervention \nThe \u2018Spirit of Wipro\u2019 promotes integrity in all facets \nof our work. Fairness and respect in the workplace \nand community are some of our key values. \nOur projects in Education, Ecology, Healthcare, \nDisaster Response and Cities and Public Spaces \nhonor these ideals. We work in these domains \nusing an approach developed through decades of \nsocial sector interventions and with an objective \nof making structural transformations that can \nhelp us develop a humane, just and equitable \nsociety collectively. \nCommunity initiatives\nApproach to CSR\nOur approach to social responsibility and sustainability rests \non three important pillars: \nThe Strategic:  We choose domains and issues to engage with \nthat are force multipliers for social change and sustainable \ndevelopment. Social responsibility is as much about being \na sustainable organization as it is about external initiatives. \nTherefore, some of our areas of engagement lie at the \nconvergence of business goals and social purpose.\nThe Systemic:  Within the chosen domains, we choose to \nengage on systemic issues that require deep, meaningful \nand challenging work. Given the nature of social change, this \nimplies commitment over the long term, typically for several \ndecades, because genuine change does take that long \nto occur.\nThe Deliberative:  Our emphasis on depth and long-term \ncommitment imply a deliberative approach that precludes \nspreading ourselves thin or engaging in \u2018cheque book \nphilanthropy.\u2019 By implication, this also means that we are \nwary of expanding and growing our social programs as ends \nin themselves. We will continue to adhere to this approach \ngoing forward. \n70\nWipro Limited | Ambitions Realized", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3282, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fbb2b720-518b-4502-acb8-f349e8578be7": {"__data__": {"id_": "fbb2b720-518b-4502-acb8-f349e8578be7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a5eca1bc-c896-41b0-ae01-c8984420b30d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "51", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "d6ce8d14487a0df8dfcb80134cdd51d047759b097efa9e734b825ec441fba2ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cebaef85-9212-4b71-a7b4-72cd8fe5d2c1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "62143ee94548c6dc9151d124b31900004fc6e9a5d2378da93c107398bf3b39b5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "5c57e4b7-ee38-4957-b959-04012e2553e1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6a715bbac761ac02d10b9a686c48f97af94118564254c50040637d5abb150cda", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Strengthening Government Schools in Bengaluru\nIn April 2019, Wipro joined hands with the Government \nof Karnataka (GoK) in collaboration with Azim Premji \nFoundation (APF) to improve the infrastructure and \nlearning environment at VV Puram (K-12) and MR \nNagar (Grade 1-7) schools in the Bengaluru Urban \nSouth District.

This has been carried out for two \nscenarios (based on the IPCC defined RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) \ncovering medium to long term (2030-2050) time frames. In both \nscenarios, we see increased probability of higher incidence of \nwater stress, and heat waves across cities.\nBelow are the list of cities and regions where we see an increase in frequency of climate change risks under RCP 4.5 scenario \n(increase of global temperatures between 1.1 to 2.6 degree celsius relative to 1986-2005).\nOther than India, impact to Wipro from physical climate risks is more prominent in: \nPhilippines  - cyclones, floods, fluctuating rainfall & humidity\nChina  - coastal flooding \nRomania - floods, droughts\nUS - tropical storms and tornadoes \nGermany, US, UK, China and Romania  - transitional risk\nRisks identified with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact over the next 5-10 years \nRegulatory: Mandates and regulation of existing products and services which include an annual increase of 5% in cost of fuel and electricity and RPO (renewable purchase \nobligations).\nChronic physical -  Rising mean temperatures can impact health and well being of employees. The financial impact is estimated based on projected number of extreme hot \ndays based on RCP8.5 warming scenario for 12 locations affecting 10% of employees and the resultant revenue loss.  \nAcute physical -  Increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods\n\u2022 Potential revenue loss due to increased employee absence from work due to disruption in the city infrastructure is estimated based on impaired inability to attend work \nfor three or more days in the coastal cities of Chennai, Kochi, Kolkata, Mumbai and Vishakapatnam in India\n\u2022 The cost of repair for damages to build infrastructure, electric equipment and disruption in electricity grids would result in increase in use of captive diesel generators in \nfew locations.\nImpacts identified using three key criteria listed \na)  People safety: Any climate-related risk that might possibly endanger the safety of 1,000 or more of our personnel at any given time in any area is classified as having a \nsignificant financial effect. We have estimated this to be 0.5% of staff in specific cities.\nb)  Wipro infrastructure: Any climate-related risks that might need the relocation of more than 25% of personnel to other sites, as well as a 10% increase in infrastructure \ncosts, are classified as having a substantial financial effect.\nc)  Customer delivery: Any climate-related risk that has the potential to influence our customer engagement by more than 25% of the relationship value is classified \nas having a substantial financial effect. Furthermore, any mission-critical service should be restored within the time frame agreed upon with clients. Our risk matrix \ncategorises climate-related threats according to (i) impact and (ii) likelihood.\nThe cumulative financial impact of physical risks, regulatory risks and chronic risks over a five year period is estimated to be around 1.5% of expenses.

Natural Capital Impacts are \ncalculated across six key performance indicators (KPIs) \nnamely, GHG emissions, air pollution, water consumption, \nwater and land pollution, waste generation and land use \nchange. The methodology uses a value for the social cost \nof carbon that varies by country and geography \u2013 typically, \nit uses a higher discount rate for developing countries as \ncompared to developed countries, given that the former \nneed more \u2018ecological space\u2019 and time to fulfill their \ndevelopmental imperatives.\nA note on the methodology: For calculating impacts due to \nair pollution only human health impacts were considered as \nthey contribute to 95% of total impact from air pollution. Land \nuse valuation was based on net change in economic value \ndue to loss of ecosystem service and was calculated only for \nthe electricity procured from the grid mix, since for the direct \noperations, land use change is not considered to be material.\nFor calculating impact due to water consumption, the \nfollowing factors were taken into consideration \u2013 impact on \nhuman health, incidence of infectious disease and impact of \nenergy consumption.\nIn FY\u201922, the total environmental costs related to Wipro\u2019s \noperations and supply chain were quantified at $0.277 billion \n($0.20 billion in FY\u201921 and $0.23 billion in FY\u201920), of which \noperational and supply chain impacts contribute 6% ($16.3 \nmillion) and 94% ($260 million) respectively.

identified the revenue recognition for fixed price contracts \nwhere the percentage-of-completion method is used as a key \naudit matter because of the significant judgement involved in \nestimating

The Company overview \n Wipro Limited (\u201cWipro\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cwe \u201d or \u201cour\u201d or \n\u201cus\u201d), is a global information technology (\u201cIT\u201d), consulting \nand business process services (\u201cBPS\u201d) company. \n Wipro is a public limited company incorporated and \ndomiciled in India. The address of its registered office is \nWipro Limited, Doddakannelli, Sarjapur Road, Bengaluru \u2013  \n560 035, Karnataka, India. The Company has its primary \nlisting with BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange of India \nLtd. The Company\u2019s American Depository Shares (\u201cADS\u201d) \nrepresenting equity shares are also listed on the New York \nStock Exchange. \n The Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorised these \nstandalone financial statements for issue on June 8, 2022. \n2. Basis of preparation of standalone \nfinancial statements \n(i) Statement of compliance and basis of \npreparation \n The standalone financial statements have been prepared \nin compliance with Indian Accounting Standards (\u201cInd AS\u201d), \nthe provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Companies \nAct\u201d), as applicable and guidelines issued by the Securities \nand Exchange Board of India (\u201cSEBI\u201d). The Ind AS are \nprescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act read \nwith Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) \nRules, 2015 and amendments issued thereafter.\n Accounting policies have been applied consistently to all \nperiods presented in these standalone financial statements, \nexcept for the adoption of new accounting standards, \namendments and interpretations effective from April 1, 2022.\n The standalone financial statements correspond to \nthe classification provisions contained in Ind AS 1, \n\u201cPresentation of Financial Statements\u201d . For clarity, various \nitems are aggregated in the statement of profit and loss and \nbalance sheet. These items are disaggregated separately \nin the notes to the standalone financial statements, where \napplicable. \n All amounts included in the standalone financial statements \nare reported in millions of Indian rupees (` in millions) \nexcept share and per share data, unless otherwise stated. \nDue to rounding off, the numbers presented throughout \nthe document may not add up precisely to the totals and \npercentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures. \nPrevious year figures have been regrouped/rearranged, \nwherever necessary.\n(ii) Basis of measurement \n The standalone financial statements have been prepared on \na historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except \nfor the following material items, which have been measured \nat fair value as required by relevant Ind AS:\na) Derivative financial instruments,b) Financial instruments classified as fair value through \nother comprehensive income or fair value through profit \nor loss,\nc) The defined benefit liability/(asset) is recognised as \nthe present value of defined benefit obligation less fair \nvalue of plan assets, and\nd) Contingent consideration.\n(iii) Use of estimates and judgment \n The preparation of these standalone financial statements \nin conformity with Ind AS requires the management to \nmake judgments, accounting estimates and assumptions \nthat affect the application of accounting policies and \nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and \nexpenses. Accounting estimates are monetary amounts \nin the standalone financial statements that are subject \nto measurement uncertainty. An accounting policy may  \nrequire items in standalone financial statements to be \nmeasured at monetary amounts that cannot be observed \ndirectly and must instead be estimated. In such a case, \nmanagement develops an accounting estimate to achieve \nthe objective set out by the accounting policy. Developing \naccounting estimates involves the use of judgements or \nassumptions based on the latest available and reliable \ninformation. Actual results may differ from those accounting \nestimates.\n Accounting estimates and underlying assumptions are \nreviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes to accounting \nestimates are recognised in the period in which the \nestimates are changed and in any future periods affected. In \nparticular, information about material areas of estimation, \nuncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting \npolicies that have the material effect on the amounts \nrecognised in the standalone financial statements are \nincluded in the following notes:\na) Revenue recognition: The Company applies judgement \nto determine whether each product or service \npromised to a customer is capable of being distinct, \nand is distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the \npromised product or service is combined and accounted \nas a single performance obligation.

In cases where \nthe Company is unable to determine the standalone \nselling price the Company uses expected cost-plus \nmargin approach in estimating the standalone selling \nprice. The Company uses the percentage of completion \nmethod using the input (cost expended) method to \nmeasure progress towards completion in respect of \nfixed price contracts. Percentage of completion method \naccounting relies on estimates of total expected \ncontract revenue and costs. This method is followed \nwhen reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues \nand costs applicable to various elements of the contract \ncan be made. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating \nthe future costs to complete include estimates of future \n(` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements \n155\nIntegrated Annual Report 2021-22Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 3887, "end_char_idx": 5818, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1031320c-be07-4efe-9498-2cd5414b5098": {"__data__": {"id_": "1031320c-be07-4efe-9498-2cd5414b5098", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5d79a2c-687f-4b84-b149-0a31be550e29", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c17d0d70891e06f4b90baa1e67899d5e6ab94077d9cad1ed07a0e0be8ca7d80d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4cccb587-4ced-41d6-a68c-02e0bd341ae4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "135", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c4bc3389ab154fbe70abee2a45ea7a7c1038999ec517f643626ff2cca7b2b022", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "e61c90f5-3eaf-411c-b8aa-c34148796f83", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "49469c7db67063fd3cc54c461aa7b9782a3b84cedbbbd6e8a83ffd98ee97eddf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS Standalone Financial Statement under Ind ASlabor costs and productivity efficiencies. Because \nthe financial reporting of these contracts depends on \nestimates that are assessed continually during the \nterm of these contracts, revenue recognised, profit \nand timing of revenue for remaining performance \nobligations are subject to revisions as the contract \nprogresses to completion. When estimates indicate \nthat a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in \nthe period in which the loss becomes probable. Volume \ndiscounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. When \nthe amount of discount varies with the levels of revenue, \nvolume discount is recorded based on estimate of future \nrevenue from the customer.\nb) Impairment testing: Goodwill and intangible assets \nwith indefinite useful life recognised on business \ncombination are tested for impairment at least annually \nand when events occur or changes in circumstances \nindicate that the recoverable amount of an asset or a \ncash generating unit to which an asset pertains is less \nthan the carrying value. The Company assesses acquired \nintangible assets with finite useful life for impairment \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The \nrecoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating \nunit is higher of value in use and fair value less cost \nof disposal. The calculation of value in use of an asset \nor a cash generating unit involves use of significant \nestimates and assumptions which include turnover, \ngrowth rates and net margins used to calculate \nprojected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rate, \nfuture economic and market conditions. \nc) Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the \nCompany are India and the United States of America.\n Significant judgments are involved in determining \nthe provision for income taxes including judgment on \nwhether tax positions are probable of being sustained in \ntax assessments. A tax assessment can involve complex \nissues, which can only be resolved over extended time \nperiods. \n Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences \nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their \ncarrying amounts, at the rates that have been enacted \nor substantively enacted at the reporting date. The \nultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent \nupon the generation of future taxable profits during the \nperiods in which those temporary differences and tax \nloss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company \nconsiders expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities \nand projected future taxable income in making this \nassessment. The amount of deferred tax assets \nconsidered realisable, however, could reduce in the near \nterm if estimates of future taxable income during the \ncarry-forward period are reduced. \nd) Business combinations: In accounting for business \ncombinations, judgment is required to assess whether \nan identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded separately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating \nthe acquisition date fair value of the identifiable \nassets acquired (including useful life estimates), \nliabilities assumed, and contingent consideration \nassumed involves management judgment. These \nmeasurements are based on information available at \nthe acquisition date and are based on expectations and \nassumptions that have been deemed reasonable by \nmanagement. Changes in these judgments, estimates, \nand assumptions can materially affect the results of \noperations. \ne) Defined benefit plans and compensated absences: \nThe cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated \nabsences and the present value of the defined benefit \nobligations are based on actuarial valuation using the \nprojected unit credit method. An actuarial valuation \ninvolves making various assumptions that may differ \nfrom actual developments in the future. These include \nthe determination of the discount rate, future salary \nincreases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities \ninvolved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a \ndefined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes \nin these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at \neach reporting date. \nf) Expected credit losses on financial assets: The \nimpairment provisions of financial assets are based on \nassumptions about risk of default and expected timing of \ncollection. The Company uses judgment in making these \nassumptions and selecting the inputs to the expected \ncredit loss calculation based on the Company\u2019s history \nof collections, customer\u2019s creditworthiness, existing \nmarket conditions as well as forward looking estimates \nat the end of each reporting period. \ng) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment: The \nCompany depreciates property, plant and equipment on \na straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the \nassets.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4980, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e61c90f5-3eaf-411c-b8aa-c34148796f83": {"__data__": {"id_": "e61c90f5-3eaf-411c-b8aa-c34148796f83", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5d79a2c-687f-4b84-b149-0a31be550e29", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "c17d0d70891e06f4b90baa1e67899d5e6ab94077d9cad1ed07a0e0be8ca7d80d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1031320c-be07-4efe-9498-2cd5414b5098", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "136", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "678dcdfec97e5ec50af792358ccba4580e02177f634733657e63d401bd4b48aa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "dcc890cd-3289-4d4c-b5fb-03a4a07848da", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3ca7c37fac1707b903202da1156598b2721f225fd647453d47be7309fbcf05d9", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "These include \nthe determination of the discount rate, future salary \nincreases and mortality rates.

Expected credit loss is \nthe difference between the contractual cash flows \nand the cash flows that the entity expects to receive \ndiscounted using the effective interest rate.\n  Loss allowances for trade receivables, unbilled \nreceivables, contract assets and finance lease \nreceivables are measured at an amount equal to \nlifetime expected credit loss. Lifetime expected credit \nlosses are the expected credit losses that result from \nall possible default events over the expected life of a \nfinancial instrument. Lifetime expected credit loss is \ncomputed based on a provision matrix which takes in \nto account, risk profiling of customers and historical \ncredit loss experience adjusted for forward looking \ninformation. For other financial assets, expected \ncredit loss is measured at the amount equal to \ntwelve months expected credit loss unless there has \nbeen a significant increase in credit risk from initial \nrecognition, in which case those are measured at \nlifetime expected credit loss. \n B) Impairment of Investment in subsidiaries\n  The Company assesses investments in subsidiaries \nfor impairment whenever events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount \nof the investment may not be recoverable. If any \nsuch indication exists, the Company estimates the \nrecoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary. \nThe recoverable amount of such investment is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal (\u201cFVLCD\u201d) \nand its value-in-use (\u201cVIU\u201d). The VIU of the investment \nis calculated using projected future cash flows. If the \nrecoverable amount of the investment is less than its \ncarrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to \nits recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an \nimpairment loss and is recognised in the statement of \nprofit and loss.\n C) Non-financial assets\n  The Company assesses long-lived assets such as \nproperty, plant and equipment, RoU assets and acquired \nintangible assets for impairment whenever events or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying \namount of an asset or group of assets may not be \nrecoverable. If any such indication exists, the Company \nestimates the recoverable amount of the asset or group \nof assets. \n  Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at \nthe same time and when events occur or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the recoverable amount of \nthe cash generating unit is less than its carrying value. \nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at the level of \ncash generating unit or groups of cash generating units \nwhich represents the lowest level at which goodwill is \nmonitored for internal management purposes. \n  The recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating \nunit is the higher of its fair value less cost of disposal \n(\u201cFVLCD\u201d) and its value-in-use (\u201cVIU\u201d). The VIU of long-\nlived assets is calculated using projected future cash \nflows. FVLCD of a cash generating unit is computed \nusing turnover and earnings multiples. If the recoverable \namount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the \ncash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less \nthan its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced \nto its recoverable amount.

Provisions for \nonerous contracts are measured at the present value of \nlower of the expected net cost of fulfilling the contract \nand the expected cost of terminating the contract.\n(xiii) Revenue\n  The Company derives revenue primarily from software \ndevelopment, maintenance of software/hardware and \nrelated services, business process services, sale of IT \nand other products.\n  Revenues from customer contracts are considered for \nrecognition and measurement when the contract has \nbeen approved by the parties to the contract, the parties \nto contract are committed to perform their respective \nobligations under the contract, and the contract is legally \nenforceable. Revenue is recognised upon transfer of \ncontrol of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company \nexpects to receive in exchange for those products or \nservices. To recognise revenues, the Company applies \nthe following five step approach: (1) identify the contract \nwith a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations \nin the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, \n(4) allocate the transaction price to the performance \nobligations in the contract, and (5) recognise revenues \nwhen a performance obligation is satisfied. When there \nis uncertainty as to collectability, revenue recognition is \npostponed until such uncertainty is resolved.\n  At contract inception, the Company assesses its promise \nto transfer products or services to a customer to identify \nseparate performance obligations. The Company applies  \njudgement to determine whether each product or \nservice promised to a customer is capable of being \ndistinct, and are distinct in the context of the contract, \nif not, the promised products or services are combined \nand accounted as a single performance obligation. The \nCompany allocates the arrangement consideration to \nseparately identifiable performance obligations based \non their relative standalone selling price or residual \nmethod.

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are \nmeasured at the tax rates that are expected to \napply in the period when the asset is realised or the \nliability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) \nthat have been enacted or substantively enacted at \nthe reporting date. \n  The Company offsets deferred income tax assets \nand liabilities, where it has a legally enforceable \nright to offset current tax assets against current \ntax liabilities, and they relate to taxes levied by \nthe same taxation authority on either the same \ntaxable entity, or on different taxable entities \nwhere there is a right and an intention to settle \nthe current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis \nor their tax assets and liabilities will be realised \nsimultaneously.\n (xvii) Earnings per share\n  Basic earnings per share is computed using the \nweighted average number of equity shares outstanding \nduring the period adjusted for treasury shares held. \nDiluted earnings per share is computed using the \nweighted-average number of equity and dilutive \nequivalent shares outstanding during the period, using \nthe treasury stock method for options, except where \nthe results would be anti-dilutive.\n  The number of equity shares and potentially dilutive \nequity shares are adjusted retrospectively for all \nperiods presented for any splits and bonus shares \nissues

indirect method, \nwhereby profit for the period is adjusted for the effects \nof transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or \naccruals of past or future operating cash receipts or \npayments and item of income or expenses associated \nwith investing or financing cash flows. The cash from \noperating, investing and financing activities of the \nCompany are segregated.\n  (xix) Assets held for sale\n  Sale of business is classified as held for sale, if their \ncarrying amount is intended to be recovered principally \nthrough sale rather than through continuing use. The \ncondition for classification as held for sale is met \nwhen disposal business is available for immediate sale \nand the same is highly probable of being completed \nwithin one year from the date of classification as held  \nfor sale.\n (xx) Discontinued operations \n  A discontinued operation is a component of the \nCompany\u2019s business that represents a separate line of business that has been disposed of or is held for sale, or \nis a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. \nClassification as a discontinued operation occurs upon \nthe earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the \ncriteria to be classified as held for sale. \n (xxi) Non-current assets and disposal \ngroups held for sale\n  Assets and liabilities of disposal groups that are \navailable for immediate sale and where the sale is \nhighly probable of being completed within one year from \nthe date of classification are considered and classified \nas assets held for sale and liabilities associated with \nassets held for sale. Non-current assets and disposal \ngroups held for sale are measured at the lower of \ncarrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n (xxii) Disposal of assets\n  The gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement of \nassets is recognised in the standalone statement of \nprofit and loss.\n  New Accounting standards, amendments and \ninterpretations adopted by the Company effective \nfrom April 1, 2021:\n  Amendment to Ind AS 116 \u2013 COVID-19-Related Rent \nConcessions \n  The economic challenges presented by the COVID-19 \npandemic have persisted longer than anticipated, \nand therefore the practical expedient relating to rent \nconcessions arising as a consequence of COVID-19 has \nbeen modified.

Goodwill is tested \nfor impairment at least annually in accordance with the Company\u2019s procedure for determining the recoverable value of each CGU.\n The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined based on FVLCD. The FVLCD of the CGU is determined based on the market \ncapitalisation approach, using the turnover and earnings multiples derived from observable market data.

agreement between the Company and \nthe counterparty allows for net settlement of the relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on a net basis. \nIn the absence of such an election, financial assets and liabilities will be settled on a gross basis and hence are not offset.\nFair value\nFinancial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease \nreceivables, employee and other advances, eligible current and non-current assets, borrowings, trade payables, and eligible \ncurrent liabilities and non-current liabilities.\nThe fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, finance lease receivables, borrowings and \nbank overdrafts, trade payables and accrued expenses, other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying \namount largely due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company\u2019s long-term debt has been contracted at market \nrates of interest. Accordingly, the carrying value of such long-term debt approximates fair value. Further, finance lease receivables \nare periodically evaluated based on individual credit worthiness of customers. Based on this evaluation, the Company records \nallowance for estimated losses on these receivables. As at March 31, 2022, and 2021 the carrying value of such receivables, net \nof allowances approximates the fair value.\nInvestments in short-term mutual funds and fixed maturity plans, which are classified as FVTPL are measured using net asset \nvalues at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held. Fair value of investments in non-convertible debentures, government \nsecurities, commercial papers, certificate of deposit and bonds classified as FVTOCI is determined based on the indicative quotes \nof price and yields prevailing in the market at the reporting date. Fair value of investments in equity instruments classified as \nFVTOCI or FVTPL is determined using market multiples method.\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable market inputs including currency spot and \nforward rates, yield curves, currency volatility etc.\n Fair value hierarchy\n The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method. The different levels have been defined \nas follows:\n Level 1  \u2013 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n Level 2 \u2013 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  \n(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).\n Level 3 \u2013 Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\n There were no transfers between Level 1, 2 and 3 during the year ended March 31, 2022.\n(` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements \n186\nWipro Limited | Ambitions Realized", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3998, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f40bf28c-e037-45b4-b6fe-ad54abbb89fc": {"__data__": {"id_": "f40bf28c-e037-45b4-b6fe-ad54abbb89fc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ad9433cb-1f94-4a80-b337-a276322284fc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e8cd9fc2fcadd6ff7b65db83693804d9796bbb8dea09cd9ad3ad98da3d1a2add", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "326a8a35-944c-49a8-9fbc-1c64f9b44d05", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "166", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "97d2d30f7d8a2b8dc01a8967fc0620a8f7697d02379491c523bf40561cc20018", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "389fc6d1-e56d-4b47-8e52-cda1c9e0af8c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d263c478c49c8ce51911fc0c91321e25bd8f51700b49d8fe8617a6230005e159", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS The following table presents fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nParticularAs at March 31, 2022 As at March 31, 2021\nFair value measurements at reporting date Fair value measurements at reporting date\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nDerivative instruments:\nCash flow hedges ` 2,242\u00a0 ` -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ` 2,242\u00a0 ` -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ` 2,998\u00a0 ` -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ` 2,998\u00a0 ` -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOthers 759\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 759\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,067\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 1,067\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nInvestments:\nShort-term mutual funds 15,312\u00a0 15,312\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 22,750\u00a0 22,750\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nFixed maturity plan mutual funds 513\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 513\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEquity instruments \u2013 other than subsidiaries 150\u00a0 41\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 109\u00a0 143\u00a0 26\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 117\u00a0\nRedeemable preference shares of subsidiary 15,269\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15,269\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nNon-convertible debentures, government \nsecurities, commercial papers, certificate of \ndeposit and bonds204,839\u00a0 1,251\u00a0 203,588\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 131,832\u00a0 2,217\u00a0 129,615\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLiabilities\nDerivative instruments:\nCash flow hedges ` (299) ` -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ` (299) ` -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ` (816) ` -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ` (816) ` -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nOthers (334) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (334) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (205) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (205) -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the level 2 financial instruments included in the \nabove table.\nDerivative instruments (assets and liabilities): The Company enters derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, \nprimarily banks with investment grade credit ratings.

The most \nfrequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing, swap models and Black Scholes models (for option valuation), \nusing present value calculations. The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign \nexchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying. As at March 31, 2022, the \nchanges in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in \nhedge relationships and other financial instruments recognised at fair value.\nInvestment in non-convertible debentures, government securities, commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds: \nFair value of these instruments is derived based on the indicative quotes of price and yields prevailing in the market as at \nreporting date.\nInvestment in equity instruments and Fixed maturity plan mutual funds: Fair value of these instruments is derived based on \nthe indicative quotes of price prevailing in the market as at reporting date.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the level 3 financial instruments included in the \nabove table.\nInvestment in equity instruments: Fair value of these instruments is determined using market multiples method.\n(` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements \n187\nIntegrated Annual Report 2021-22Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3250, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "389fc6d1-e56d-4b47-8e52-cda1c9e0af8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "389fc6d1-e56d-4b47-8e52-cda1c9e0af8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "72101a21-9eda-4883-8c46-52d3e80821cd", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "168", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "f4b4ce06af662a13b115cc163eeac55ffa7a2400b4c8ad1722480026d7f48e09", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f40bf28c-e037-45b4-b6fe-ad54abbb89fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "167", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e8cd9fc2fcadd6ff7b65db83693804d9796bbb8dea09cd9ad3ad98da3d1a2add", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d41f98a2-e9b1-46bc-980e-a4a68c6ad61a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f07ae3b0b216ed7b9e7037dc7ad3599fedf715e75179be928e618f32ec4ac9f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS Standalone Financial Statement under Ind ASDetails of assets and liabilities considered under Level 3 classification\nInvestment in equity instruments - other than subsidiariesAs at \nMarch 31, 2022As at \nMarch 31, 2021\nBalance at the beginning of the year\u00a0 \u00a0` 117\u00a0 \u00a0` 152\u00a0\nAdditions 10\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nLoss recognised in other comprehensive income (18) (8)\nTransfer out of Level 3 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (27)\nBalance at the end of the year\u00a0 \u00a0` 109\u00a0 \u00a0` 117\u00a0\nInvestment in redeemable preference shares of subsidiaryAs at \nMarch 31, 2022As at \nMarch 31, 2021\nBalance at the beginning of the year \u00a0` -\u00a0 \u00a0` -\u00a0\nAdditions 15,269\u00a0 -\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nBalance at the end of the year \u00a0` 15,269\u00a0 \u00a0` -\u00a0\n Derivative assets and liabilities:\nThe Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency assets/liabilities, forecasted cash flows \ndenominated in foreign currency and net investment in foreign operations.

Gains and losses on sale of financial assets without recourse are recorded at the time of sale based on the \ncarrying value of the financial assets and fair value of servicing liability. The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash \nflow and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2022 and March 31, 2021 is not material.\nIn certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse. Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is obligated \nto repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits specified in the agreement with the banks. These are reflected \nas part of borrowings in the balance sheet.\nFinancial risk management \nMarket Risk \nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price \nof a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign \ncurrency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable \nto all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and \nborrowings. \nThe Company\u2019s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities in \nforeign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company\u2019s earnings and equity \nto losses. \nRisk Management Procedures \nThe Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent \ncontrol over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk management \nobjectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities of this department \ninclude management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, \nand ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies.\nForeign currency risk \nThe Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently, the \nCompany is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States of America \nand elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies. The exchange rate risk primarily \narises from foreign exchange revenue, receivables, cash balances, forecasted cash flows, payables and foreign currency loans \nand borrowings. A significant portion of the Company\u2019s revenue is in the US Dollar, the Pound Sterling, the Euro, the Canadian \nDollar and the Australian Dollar, while a large portion of costs are in Indian rupees. The exchange rate between the rupee and \nthese currencies has fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to fluctuate in the future. Appreciation of the \nrupee against these currencies can adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from these transactions and enters foreign currency derivative \ninstruments to mitigate such exposure. The Company follows established risk management policies, including the use of \nderivatives like foreign exchange forward/option contracts to hedge forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currency. \nThe Company has designated certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange exposure of \nforecasted highly probable cash flows. \nAs at March 31, 2022, a ` 1 increase in the spot exchange rate of the Indian rupee with the US dollar would result in approximately  \n` 3,159 (statement of profit and loss ` 1,366 and other comprehensive income ` 1,793) decrease in the fair value, and a ` 1 \ndecrease would result in approximately ` 3,165\u00a0(statement of profit and loss ` 1,366 and other comprehensive income ` 1,799) \nincrease in the fair value of foreign currency dollar denominated derivative instruments (forward and option contracts).\n(` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Standalone

Issuer risk is minimised by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in \nIndia based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with \ncounterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings.

recognised in other comprehensive income and presented within equity. Other \nthan these, the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities is primarily recorded in the statement of profit and loss.\n In assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers the extent to which it is probable that the deferred \ntax asset will be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable \nprofits during the periods in which those temporary differences and tax loss carry-forwards become deductible. The Company \nconsiders the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making \nthis assessment. Based on this, the Company believes that it is probable that the Company will realise the benefits of these \ndeductible differences. The amount of deferred tax asset considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if the \nestimates of future taxable income during the carry-forward period are reduced. \n The Company has recognised deferred tax assets of ` 1,169 and ` 548 as at March 31, 2022 and 2021 primarily in respect of \ncapital loss incurred on account of liquidation of an investment. Management\u2019s projections of future taxable capital gain support \nthe assumption that it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available to utilise this deferred tax asset.\n We have calculated our domestic tax liability under normal provisions. Accordingly, no deferred tax asset has been recognised \ntowards MAT in the balance sheet for the years ended March\u00a031, 2022 and 2021. The effective MAT rate is 17.47%. The excess \ntax paid under MAT provisions over and above normal tax liability can be carried forward for a period of fifteen years and set-off \nagainst future tax liabilities computed under normal tax provisions.\n A substantial portion of the profits of the Company\u2019s India operations are exempt from Indian income taxes being profits \nattributable to export operations and profits from units established under Special Economic Zone Act, 2005 scheme. Units in \ndesignated special economic zones providing service on or after April\u00a01, 2005 will be eligible for a deduction of 100 percent of \nprofits or gains derived from the export of services for the first five years from commencement of provision of services and 50 \npercent of such profits and gains for a further five years. Certain tax benefits are also available for a further five years. 50% tax \ndeduction is available for a further five years subject to the unit meeting certain defined conditions. Profits from certain other \nundertakings are also eligible for preferential tax treatment. New SEZ units set up on or after April 1, 2021 are not eligible for \naforesaid deduction. The tax holiday period being currently available to the Company expires in various years through fiscal \n2034-35. The impact of tax holidays has resulted in a decrease of current tax expense of ` 16,483 and ` 11,458 for the years \nended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, compared to the effective tax amounts that we estimate we would have been \nrequired to pay if these incentives had not been available. The per share effect of these tax incentives for the years ended March \n31, 2022 and 2021 was ` 2.95 and ` 2.03, respectively. \n Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary \ndifferences associated with US branch profit tax where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled \nand it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Revenue from operations\n A. Contract Assets and Liabilities\n  The Company classifies its right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. \n  A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of \ntime is required before payment of that consideration is due. For example, the Company recognises a receivable for revenues \nrelated to time and materials contracts or volume-based contracts. The Company presents such receivables as part of \nunbilled receivables at their net estimated realisable value. The same is tested for impairment as per the guidance in Ind AS \n109 using expected credit loss method.\n  Contract assets: During the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, ` 9,978 and ` 11,451 of contract assets pertaining to \nfixed-price development contracts have been reclassified to receivables on completion of milestones.\n  Contract liabilities: During the years ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognised revenue of ` 15,150 and  \n` 11,978 arising from contract liabilities as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively.\n  Contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting \nperiod.\n B. Remaining Performance Obligations\n  Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognised, \nwhich includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognised as revenue in future periods. Applying the \npractical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds \ndirectly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on \ntime and material basis and volume based.\n  As at March 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, \nother than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ` 171,136 and ` 224,746, respectively of which approximately \n70% and 71%, respectively is expected to be recognised as revenues within two years, and the remainder thereafter. This \nincludes contracts, with a substantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause by the \ncustomer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time of inception. Historically, customers have \nnot terminated contracts without cause.\n C. Disaggregation of Revenue\n  The tables below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment and nature of contract. \nThe Company believes that the below disaggregation best depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and \ncash flows from economic factors\nRevenue by business segment\u00a0\nYear  ended \nMarch 31, 2022Year  ended \nMarch 31, 2021\nRendering of services \u00a0` 590,956\u00a0 \u00a0`  496,434\u00a0\nSale of products 4,788\u00a0 6,560\u00a0\n\u00a0`  595,744\u00a0 \u00a0`  502,994\u00a0\nRevenue by nature of contract\nYear  ended \nMarch 31, 2022Year  ended \nMarch 31, 2021\nFixed price and volume based \u00a0`  359,322\u00a0 \u00a0` 301,694\u00a0\nTime and material 231,634\u00a0 194,740\u00a0\nProducts 4,788\u00a0 6,560\u00a0\n\u00a0` 595,744\u00a0 \u00a0` 502,994\u00a0\n(` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Standalone Financial Statements \n196\nWipro Limited | Ambitions Realized", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3491, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fdb71955-1d61-4619-9f0d-753325743bd5": {"__data__": {"id_": "fdb71955-1d61-4619-9f0d-753325743bd5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "31c2d431-5b66-499d-9959-97634e97c993", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "177", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3fa38b55a069ce4058552542c96a69b8a5e39e101ad42f05c8d4a4e1aa12367b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8b20bfd0-608f-47d8-a494-afa0d5345253", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "176", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "aa93ff08f221c056762de11da504bf2a07136737d1f80a5ea99c05d5fbf8ad6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9c39ddeb-25ba-4660-ba29-74db936df7ce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "42e6ca48ab017437886bafd8e968e6f067b3bb8ed74f9da414ae013ee30d5c9b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS Standalone Financial Statement under Ind AS23.

These claims are primarily arising out of denial of deduction under Section 10A of the Income Tax Act, 1961 in respect \nof profit earned by the Company\u2019s undertaking in Software Technology Park at Bengaluru, the appeals filed against the said de -\nmand before the Appellate authorities have been allowed in favor of the Company by the second appellate authority for the years \nup to March 31, 2008 which either has been or may be contested by the Income tax authorities before the Supreme Court of India. \nOther claims relate to disallowance of tax benefits on profits earned from Software Technology Park and Special Economic Zone \nunits, capitalisation of research and development expenses, transfer pricing adjustments on intercompany/interunit transac -\ntions and other issues.\n Income tax claims against the Company amounting to ` 92,388 and ` 80,032 are not acknowledged as debt as at March 31, 2022 \nand March 31, 2021, respectively.

However, the resolution of these disputed demands \nis not likely to have a material and adverse effect on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company.\n The Hon\u2019ble Supreme Court of India, through a ruling in February 2019, provided interpretation on the components of Salary on \nwhich the Company and its employees are to contribute towards Provident Fund under the Employee\u2019s Provident Fund Act. Based \non the current evaluation, the Company believes it is not probable that certain components of Salary paid by the Company will \nbe subject to contribution towards Provident Fund due to the Supreme Court order.

identified the revenue recognition for fixed price contracts \nwhere the percentage-of-completion method is used as a key \naudit matter because of the significant judgement involved in \nestimating

The Company Overview \n Wipro Limited (\u201cWipro\u201d or the \u201cParent Company\u201d), together \nwith its subsidiaries and controlled trusts (collectively, \n\u201cwe \u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201c our\u201d, \u201c the Company\u201d or the \u201cGroup\u201d) is a global \ninformation technology (\u201cIT\u201d), consulting and business \nprocess services (\u201cBPS\u201d) company.\n Wipro is a public limited company incorporated and \ndomiciled in India. The address of its registered office \nis Wipro Limited, Doddakannelli, Sarjapur Road,  \nBengaluru \u2013 560 035, Karnataka, India. The Company has its \nprimary listing with BSE Ltd. and National Stock Exchange \nof India Ltd. The Company\u2019s American Depository Shares \n(\u201cADS\u201d) representing equity shares are also listed on the \nNew York Stock Exchange. \n The Company\u2019s Board of Directors authorised these \nconsolidated financial statements for issue on June\u00a08, 2022.\n2. Basis of Preparation of Consolidated \nFinancial Statements \n(i) Statement of compliance and basis of \npreparation\n The consolidated financial statements have been prepared \nin compliance with Indian Accounting Standards (\u201cInd AS\u201d), \nthe provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 (\u201cthe Companies \nAct\u201d), as applicable and guidelines issued by the Securities \nand Exchange Board of India (\u201cSEBI\u201d). The Ind AS are \nprescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act read \nwith Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) \nRules, 2015 and amendments issued thereafter.\n The consolidated financial statements correspond \nto the classification provisions contained in Ind AS 1, \n\u201cPresentation of Financial Statements\u201d . For clarity, various \nitems are aggregated in the consolidated statement of \nprofit and loss and consolidated balance sheet. These \nitems are disaggregated separately in the notes to the \nconsolidated financial statements, where applicable. The \naccounting policies have been consistently applied to all \nperiods presented in these financial statements, except for \nthe adoption of new accounting standards, amendments \nand interpretations effective from April 1, 2021.\n All amounts included in the consolidated financial \nstatements are reported in millions of Indian rupees (` in \nmillions) except share and per share data, unless otherwise \nstated. Due to rounding off, the numbers presented \nthroughout the document may not add up precisely to \nthe totals and percentages may not precisely reflect the \nabsolute figures. Previous year figures have been regrouped/\nrearranged, wherever necessary.\n(ii) Basis of measurement \n The consolidated financial statements have been prepared \non a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, \nexcept for the following material items which have been measured at fair value as required by relevant Ind AS: \na. Derivative financial instruments; \nb. Financial instruments classified as fair value through \nother comprehensive income or fair value through \nprofit or loss;\nc. The defined benefit liability/(asset) is recognised as \nthe present value of defined benefit obligation less fair \nvalue of plan assets; and \nd. Contingent consideration.\n(iii) Use of estimates and judgment \n The preparation of these consolidated financial statements \nin conformity with Ind AS requires the management to \nmake judgments, accounting estimates and assumptions \nthat affect the application of accounting policies and \nthe reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and \nexpenses. Accounting estimates are monetary amounts in \nthe consolidated financial statements that are subject to \nmeasurement uncertainty.  An accounting policy may require \nitems in consolidated financial statements to be measured \nat monetary amounts that cannot be observed directly and \nmust instead be estimated. In such a case, management \ndevelops an accounting estimate to achieve the objective \nset out by the accounting policy. Developing accounting \nestimates involves the use of judgements or assumptions \nbased on the latest available and reliable information. \nActual results may differ from those accounting estimates.\n Accounting estimates and underlying assumptions are \nreviewed on an ongoing basis.

Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the \nfuture costs to complete include estimates of future \nlabor costs and productivity efficiencies. Because \nthe financial reporting of these contracts depends on \nestimates that are assessed continually during the \nterm of these contracts, revenue recognised, profit \nand timing of revenue for remaining performance \nobligations are subject to revisions as the contract \nprogresses to completion. When estimates indicate \nthat a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in \nthe period in which the loss becomes probable. Volume \ndiscounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. \nWhen the amount of discount varies with the levels \nof revenue, volume discount is recorded based on \nestimate of future revenue from the customer.\nb) Impairment testing: Goodwill and intangible assets \nwith indefinite useful life recognised on business \ncombination are tested for impairment at least \nannually and when events occur or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the recoverable amount \nof an asset or a cash generating unit to which an asset \npertains, is less than the carrying value. The Company \nassesses acquired intangible assets with finite useful \nlife for impairment whenever events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount may \nnot be recoverable. The recoverable amount of an \nasset or a cash generating unit is higher of value-in-\nuse and fair value less cost of disposal. The calculation \nof value-in-use of an asset or a cash generating unit \ninvolves use of significant estimates and assumptions \nwhich include turnover, growth rates and net margins \nused to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-\nadjusted discount rate, future economic and market \nconditions.\nc) Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the \nCompany are India and the United States of America. \n Significant judgments are involved in determining \nthe provision for income taxes including judgment on \nwhether tax positions are probable of being sustained \nin tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve \ncomplex issues, which can only be resolved over \nextended time periods. \n Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences \nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and \ntheir carrying amounts, at the rates that have been \nenacted or substantively enacted at the reporting \ndate. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets \nis dependent upon the generation of future taxable \nprofits during the periods in which those temporary \ndifferences and tax loss carry forwards become \ndeductible. The Company considers expected reversal \nof deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable \nincome in making this assessment. The amount of \ndeferred tax assets considered realisable, however, \ncould reduce in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are \nreduced. \nd) Business combinations: In accounting for business \ncombinations, judgment is required to assess whether \nan identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded \nseparately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating \nthe acquisition date fair value of the identifiable \nassets acquired (including useful life estimates), \nliabilities assumed, and contingent consideration \nassumed involves management judgment.

The Group controls an entity when \nthe parent has power over the entity, it is exposed to, or has \nrights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity \nand has the ability to affect those returns through its power \nover the entity. The financial statements of subsidiaries and \ncontrolled trusts are included in the consolidated financial \nstatements from the date on which control commences \nuntil the date on which control ceases.\n The financial statements of the Group companies are \nconsolidated on a line-by-line basis and all intra-Group \nbalances, transactions, income and expenses are eliminated \nin full on consolidation.\n Non-controlling interests\n Non-controlling interests in the net assets (excluding \ngoodwill) of consolidated subsidiaries are identified \nseparately from the Company\u2019s equity. The interest of non-\ncontrolling shareholders may be initially measured either at \nfair value or at the non-controlling interest\u2019s proportionate \nshare of the fair value of the acquiree\u2019s identifiable net \nassets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an \nacquisition to acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, \nthe carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the \namount of those interests at initial recognition plus the \nnon-controlling interest\u2019s share of subsequent changes in \nequity.

Such arrangements are generally \nfor a fixed period but may have extension or termination \noptions. The Company assesses, whether the contract \nis, or contains, a lease, at its inception. A contract is, or \ncontains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to \u2013 \n(a) control use of an identified asset,\n(b) obtain substantially all the economic benefits from \nuse of the identified asset, and\n(c) direct the use of the identified asset.\n The Company determines the lease term as the non-\ncancellable period of a lease, together with periods \ncovered by an option to extend the lease, where the \nCompany is reasonably certain to exercise that option.\n The Company at the commencement of the lease contract \nrecognises a Right of Use (\u201cRoU \u201d) asset at cost and \ncorresponding lease liability, except for leases with term \nof less than twelve months (short-term leases) and low-\nvalue assets. For these short-term and low-value leases, \nthe Company recognises the lease payments as an \noperating expense on a straight-line basis over the lease \nterm.\n The cost of the RoU assets comprises the amount of \nthe initial measurement of the lease liability, any lease \npayments made at or before the inception date of the \nlease plus any initial direct costs, less any lease incentives \nreceived. Subsequently, the RoU assets are measured at \ncost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated \nimpairment losses, if any. The RoU assets are depreciated \nusing the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter of lease term or useful life of RoU \nassets. The estimated useful lives of RoU assets are \ndetermined on the same basis as those of property, plant \nand equipment.\n The Company applies Ind AS 36 to determine whether \na RoU asset is impaired and accounts for any identified \nimpairment loss as described in the impairment of non-\nfinancial assets below.\n For lease liabilities at the commencement of the lease, \nthe Company measures the lease liability at the present \nvalue of the lease payments that are not paid at that date. \nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate \nimplicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determined, if \nthat rate is not readily determined, the lease payments are \ndiscounted using the incremental borrowing rate that the \nCompany would have to pay to borrow funds, including the \nconsideration of factors such as the nature of the asset \nand location, collateral, market terms and conditions, as \napplicable in a similar economic environment. \n After the commencement date, the amount of lease \nliabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest \nand reduced for the lease payments made.\n The Company recognises the amount of the re-\nmeasurement of lease liability as an adjustment to \nthe RoU assets. Where the carrying amount of the RoU \nasset is reduced to zero and there is a further reduction \nin the measurement of the lease liability, the Company \nrecognises any remaining amount of the re-measurement \nin consolidated statement of profit and loss.\n Payment of lease liabilities are classified as cash used in \nfinancing activities in the consolidated statement of cash \nflows.\n The Company as a lessor\n Leases under which the Company is a lessor are classified \nas a finance or operating lease.

The Company makes annual \ncontributions based on a specified percentage of \neach eligible employee\u2019s salary.\nb)\t Termination\t benefits: \tTermination benefits are \nexpensed when the Company can no longer withdraw \nthe offer of those benefits. \nc)\t Short-term\t benefits: \tShort-term employee benefit \nobligations such as cash bonus, management incentive \nplans or profit-sharing plans are measured on an \nundiscounted basis and are recorded as expense as \nthe related service is provided. A liability is recognised \nfor the amount expected to be paid under short-term \ncash bonus, management incentive plans or profit-\nsharing plans, if the Company has a present legal or \nconstructive obligation to pay this amount as a result \nof past service provided by the employee and the \nobligation can be estimated reliably. \nd) Compensated absences: The employees of the \nCompany are entitled to compensated absences. The \nemployees can carry forward a portion of the unutilised \naccumulating compensated absences and utilise \nit in future periods or receive cash at retirement or \ntermination of employment. The Company records an \nobligation for compensated absences in the period in \nwhich the employee renders the services that increases \nthis entitlement. The Company measures the expected \ncost of compensated absences as the additional \namount that the Company expects to pay as a result of \nthe unused entitlement that has accumulated at the \nend of the reporting period. The Company recognises \naccumulated compensated absences based on \nactuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method. Non-accumulating compensated absences \nare recognised in the period in which the absences \noccur. \n(xii) Share-based payment transactions \n Selected employees of the Company receive remuneration \nin the form of equity settled instruments or cash settled \ninstruments, for rendering services over a defined vesting \nperiod and for Company\u2019s performance-based stock options \nover the defined period. Equity instruments granted are \nmeasured by reference to the fair value of the instrument \nat the date of grant. In cases, where equity instruments are \ngranted at a nominal exercise price, the intrinsic value on \nthe date of grant approximates the fair value. The expense \nis recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and \nloss with a corresponding increase to the share options \noutstanding account, a component of equity.\n The equity instruments or cash settled instruments \ngenerally vest in a graded manner over the vesting period. \nThe fair value determined at the grant date is expensed \nover the vesting period of the respective tranches of such \ngrants (accelerated amortisation). The stock compensation \nexpense is determined based on the Company\u2019s estimate \nof equity instruments or cash settled instruments that will \neventually vest.\n Cash settled instruments granted are re-measured by \nreference to the fair value at the end of each reporting \nperiod and at the time of vesting. The expense is recognised \nin the consolidated statement of profit and loss with a \ncorresponding increase to financial liability.\n(xiii)\u00a0Provisions  \n Provisions are recognised when the Company has a \npresent obligation (legal or constructive), as a result of \na past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic \nbenefits will be required to settle the obligation and \na reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the \nobligation. \n The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate \nof the consideration required to settle the present \nobligation at the end of the reporting period, considering \nthe risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4706, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b3075417-ca01-4f20-b4d0-2af556dfa855": {"__data__": {"id_": "b3075417-ca01-4f20-b4d0-2af556dfa855", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2c8c4925-97fc-479b-8475-096abd4a57fc", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e279e5f4a6d882cb3362df3db79e477e455e2290c8da96e4f796a8a214a2d4dd", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "73cfb17d-d99b-4ef8-a735-edc43f2add60", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "218", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "52bc640d492f7f3967e3ca6cdbfcbcc6a237a61811ac72d7a72d1ffface4bb03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "cff33f6f-64d4-48e6-b028-c24ded1de7fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cd40f6110ce8188eaa5a5fa2468612a326ff0aef8c7526aa8049eb31d641bab1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The stock compensation \nexpense is determined based on the Company\u2019s estimate \nof equity instruments or cash settled instruments that will \neventually vest.\n Cash settled instruments granted are re-measured by \nreference to the fair value at the end of each reporting \nperiod and at the time of vesting.

Revenue is recognised upon transfer of \ncontrol of promised products or services to customers in \nan amount that reflects the consideration the Company \nexpects to receive in exchange for those products or \nservices. To recognise revenues, the Company applies the \nfollowing five step approach: (1) identify the contract with \na customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the \ncontract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate \nthe transaction price to the performance obligations in the \ncontract, and (5) recognise revenues when a performance \nobligation is satisfied. When there is uncertainty as to \ncollectability, revenue recognition is postponed until such \nuncertainty is resolved.\n At contract inception, the Company assesses its promise \nto transfer products or services to a customer to identify \nseparate performance obligations. The Company applies \njudgement to determine whether each product or service \npromised to a customer is capable of being distinct, \nand are distinct in the context of the contract, if not, the \npromised product or service is combined and accounted \nas a single performance obligation. The Company allocates \nthe arrangement consideration to separately identifiable \nperformance obligation based on their relative standalone \nselling price or residual method. Standalone selling prices \nare determined based on sale prices for the components \nwhen it is regularly sold separately, in cases where the \nCompany is unable to determine the standalone selling \nprice the Company uses third-party prices for similar \ndeliverables or the Company uses expected cost-plus \nmargin approach in estimating the standalone selling \nprice.\n For performance obligations where control is transferred \nover time, revenues are recognised by measuring progress \ntowards completion of the performance obligation. The \nselection of the method to measure progress towards \ncompletion requires judgment and is based on the nature \nof the promised products or services to be provided.\n The method for recognizing revenues and costs depends \non the nature of the services rendered: \nA. Time and materials contracts: Revenues and costs \nrelating to time and materials contracts are recognised \nas the related services are rendered. \n B. Fixed price contracts: \ni. Fixed price development contracts: Revenues \nfrom fixed price development contracts, including \nsoftware development, and integration contracts, \nwhere the performance obligations are satisfied \nover time, are recognised using the \u201cpercentage-of-completion\u201d method. The performance \nobligations are satisfied as and when the services \nare rendered since the customer generally obtains \ncontrol of the work as it progresses. Percentage of \ncompletion is determined based on project costs \nincurred to date as a percentage of total estimated \nproject costs required to complete the project. \nThe cost expended (or input) method has been \nused to measure progress towards completion \nas there is a direct relationship between input \nand productivity. If the Company is not able to \nreasonably measure the progress of completion, \nrevenue is recognised only to the extent of costs \nincurred for which recoverability is probable. \nWhen total cost estimates exceed revenues in an \narrangement, the estimated losses are recognised \nin the consolidated statement of profit and loss in \nthe period in which such losses become probable \nbased on the current contract estimates as an \nonerous contract provision.  \n A contract asset is a right to consideration that is \nconditional upon factors other than the passage of \ntime. Contract assets primarily relate to unbilled \namounts on fixed price development contracts \nand are classified as non-financial asset as the \ncontractual right to consideration is dependent on \ncompletion of contractual milestones.\n A contract liability is an entity\u2019s obligation to transfer \ngoods or services to a customer for which the entity \nhas received consideration (or the amount is due) \nfrom the customer.\n Unbilled receivables on other than fixed price \ndevelopment contracts are classified as a \nfinancial asset where the right to consideration \nis unconditional and only the passage of time is \nrequired before the payment is due. \nii.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4755, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "dee6c41e-c02f-49bc-baff-e85fa816bb43": {"__data__": {"id_": "dee6c41e-c02f-49bc-baff-e85fa816bb43", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "41d5e492-35d5-4a7e-8198-3259fbef2860", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e7315643f53f17e0e784c8ce90340a79ee1f08d6f1376713fdae97517c53f599", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cff33f6f-64d4-48e6-b028-c24ded1de7fc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "219", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "10121a954bd7b415c5701e7017d73318fcdd35d15076ce750685597e707c585d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "757af4a2-79be-41d3-8bb4-49a08b83724e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "4c70134658ec734843b54aa84836bbfe3f5a0b1fba89a7ea84be95bd3e6a8476", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "A contract asset is a right to consideration that is \nconditional upon factors other than the passage of \ntime.

Element or Volume based contracts: Revenues \nand costs are recognised as the related services are \nrendered. \nC. Products: Revenue on product sales are recognised \nwhen the customer obtains control of the specified \nproduct. \n D . Others\n\u2022\tAny change in scope or price is considered to be a \ncontract modification. The Company accounts for \nmodifications to existing contracts by assessing \nwhether the services added are distinct and whether \nthe pricing is at the standalone selling price. \nServices added that are not distinct are accounted \nfor on a cumulative catch up basis, while those that \nare distinct are accounted for prospectively, either \nas a separate contract if the additional services \nare priced at the standalone selling price, or as a \ntermination of the existing contract and creation of \na new contract if not priced at the standalone selling \nprice.\n\u2022\tThe Company accounts for variable considerations \nlike, volume discounts, rebates and pricing \nincentives to customers and penalties as reduction \nof revenue on a systematic and rational basis over \nthe period of the contract. The Company estimates \nan amount of such variable consideration using \nexpected value method or the single most likely \namount in a range of possible consideration \ndepending on which method better predicts the \namount of consideration to which the Company may \nbe entitled and when it is probable that a significant \nreversal of cumulative revenue recognised will not \noccur when the uncertainty associated with the \nvariable consideration is resolved.\n\u2022\tRevenues are shown net of allowances/returns, \nsales tax, value added tax, goods and services tax \nand applicable discounts and allowances. \n\u2022\tThe Company accrues the estimated cost of \nwarranties at the time when the revenue is \nrecognised. The accruals are based on the \nCompany\u2019s historical experience of material usage \nand service delivery costs. \n\u2022\tIncremental costs that relate directly to a contract \nand incurred in securing a contract with a customer \nare recognised as an asset when the Company \nexpects to recover these costs and amortised over \nthe contract term. \n\u2022\tThe Company recognises contract fulfilment cost \nas an asset if those costs specifically relate to a \ncontract or to an anticipated contract, the costs \ngenerate or enhance resources that will be used in \nsatisfying performance obligations in future; and \nthe costs are expected to be recovered.

As a \npractical expedient, the Company does not assess \nthe existence of a significant financing component \nwhen the difference between payment and transfer \nof deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in \ntiming arises for reasons other than the provision \nof finance to either the customer or us, no financing \ncomponent is deemed to exist.\n\u2022\tThe Company may enter into arrangements with \nthird party suppliers to resell products or services. \nIn such cases, the Company evaluates whether the \nCompany is the principal (i.e. report revenues on a \ngross basis) or agent (i.e. report revenues on a net \nbasis). In doing so, the Company first evaluates \nwhether the Company controls the good or service \nbefore it is transferred to the customer. If Company \ncontrols the good or service before it is transferred \nto the customer, Company is the principal; if not, the \nCompany is the agent.\n\u2022\tEstimates of transaction price and total costs or \nefforts are continuously monitored over the term of \nthe contract and are recognised in net profit in the \nperiod when these estimates change or when the \nestimates are revised.

The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company\u2019s earnings and equity \nto losses. \n Risk Management Procedures \n The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent \ncontrol over the entire process of market risk management.

The Company presents such receivables as part of \nunbilled\treceivables\tat\ttheir\tnet\testimated\trealisable\tvalue. \tThe\tsame\tis\ttested\tfor\timpairment\tas\tper\tthe\tguidance\tin\tInd\tAS\t\n109 using expected credit loss method.\nContract assets: During the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, ` 13,944 and ` 15,101 of contract assets pertaining to \nfixed\tprice\tdevelopment\tcontracts\thave\tbeen\treclassified\tto\treceivables\ton\tcompletion\tof\tmilestones.\nContract liabilities: During the year ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognised revenue of ` 18,880 and ` \n16,082 arising from contract liabilities as at March 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively.\n Contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting \nperiod.\nB. Remaining Performance Obligations\n Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognised, \nwhich includes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognised as revenue in future periods. Applying the \npractical expedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds \ndirectly with the value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on \ntime and material basis and volume based.\n As at March 31, 2022 and 2021, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, \nother than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ` 328,191 and ` 384,881, respectively, of which approximately \n59% and 59%, respectively, is expected to be recognised as revenues within two years, and the remainder thereafter. This \nincludes contracts with a substantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause by the \ncustomer,\tbased\ton\tan\toverall\tassessment\t of\tthe\tcontract\tcarried\tout\tat\tthe\ttime\tof\tinception.\tHistorically, \tcustomers\thave\t\nnot terminated contracts without cause.\n C.

Our responsibility is to express an \nopinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our \naudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the \nPCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the \nCompany in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws \nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and \nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of \nthe PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform \nthe audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the \nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether \ndue to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures \nto assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing \nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and \ndisclosures in the financial statements.

Basis of preparation of consolidated \nfinancial statements \n(i) Statement of compliance and basis of \npreparation \n The consolidated financial statements have been prepared \nin compliance with International Financial Reporting \nStandards and its interpretations (\u201cIFRS\u201d), as issued by \nthe International Accounting Standards Board (\u201cIASB\u201d). \nAll accounting policies have been applied consistently \nto all periods presented in these consolidated financial \nstatements, except for new accounting standards adopted \nby the Company. \n The consolidated financial statements correspond to \nthe classification provisions contained in IAS 1 (revised), \n\u201cPresentation of Financial Statements\u201d .

Due to rounding off, the numbers presented \nthroughout the document may not add up precisely to \nthe totals and percentages may not precisely reflect the \nabsolute figures. Previous year figures have been regrouped/\nrearranged, wherever necessary.\n(ii) Basis of measurement \n The consolidated financial statements have been prepared \non a historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, \nexcept for the following material items which have been \nmeasured at fair value as required by relevant IFRS:\na. Derivative financial instruments,b. Financial instruments classified as fair value through \nother comprehensive income or fair value through \nprofit or loss, \nc.

Accounting estimates are monetary amounts \nin the consolidated financial statements that are subject \nto measurement uncertainty. An accounting policy may \nrequire items in consolidated financial statements to be \nmeasured at monetary amounts that cannot be observed \ndirectly and must instead be estimated.

The Company allocates the arrangement \nconsideration to separately identifiable performance \nobligation deliverables based on their relative stand-\nalone selling price. In cases where the Company is \nunable to determine the standalone selling price the \nCompany uses expected cost-plus margin approach in \nestimating the standalone selling price. The Company \nuses the percentage of completion method using the \ninput (cost expended) method to measure progress \ntowards completion in respect of fixed price contracts. \nPercentage of completion method accounting relies \non estimates of total expected contract revenue \nand costs. This method is followed when reasonably \ndependable estimates of the revenues and costs \napplicable to various elements of the contract can be \nmade. Key factors that are reviewed in estimating the \nfuture costs to complete include estimates of future \nlabor costs and productivity efficiencies. Because \nthe financial reporting of these contracts depends on \nestimates that are assessed continually during the \nterm of these contracts, revenue recognized, profit \nand timing of revenue for remaining performance \nobligations are subject to revisions as the contract \nprogresses to completion. When estimates indicate \nthat a loss will be incurred, the loss is provided for in \nthe period in which the loss becomes probable. Volume \ndiscounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue. \nWhen the amount of discount varies with the levels \nof revenue, volume discount is recorded based on \nestimate of future revenue from the customer. \nb) Impairment testing: Goodwill and intangible assets \nwith indefinite useful life recognized on business \ncombination are tested for impairment at least \nannually and when events occur or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the recoverable amount \nof an asset or a cash generating unit to which an asset \npertains is less than the carrying value. The Company \nassesses acquired intangible assets with finite useful \nlife for impairment whenever events or changes in \ncircumstances indicate that the carrying amount may \nnot be recoverable. The recoverable amount of an \nasset or a cash generating unit is higher of value-in-\nuse and fair value less cost of disposal. The calculation \nof value in use of an asset or a cash generating unit \ninvolves use of significant estimates and assumptions  \nwhich include turnover, growth rates and net margins \nused to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-\nadjusted discount rate, future economic and market \nconditions. \nc) Income taxes: The major tax jurisdictions for the \nCompany are India and the United States of America. \n Significant judgments are involved in determining \nthe provision for income taxes including judgment on \nwhether tax positions are probable of being sustained \nin tax assessments. A tax assessment can involve \ncomplex issues, which can only be resolved over \nextended time periods.  Deferred tax is recorded on temporary differences \nbetween the tax bases of assets and liabilities and \ntheir carrying amounts, at the rates that have been \nenacted or substantively enacted at the reporting \ndate. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets \nis dependent upon the generation of future taxable \nprofits during the periods in which those temporary \ndifferences and tax loss carry-forwards become \ndeductible. The Company considers expected reversal \nof deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable \nincome in making this assessment. The amount of \ndeferred tax assets considered realizable, however, \ncould reduce in the near term if estimates of future \ntaxable income during the carry forward period are \nreduced. \nd) Business combinations: In accounting for business \ncombinations, judgment is required to assess whether \nan identifiable intangible asset is to be recorded \nseparately from goodwill. Additionally, estimating \nthe acquisition date fair value of the identifiable \nassets acquired (including useful life estimates), \nliabilities assumed, and contingent consideration \nassumed involves management judgment. These \nmeasurements are based on information available at \nthe acquisition date and are based on expectations \nand assumptions that have been deemed reasonable \nby management. Changes in these judgments, \nestimates, and assumptions can materially affect the \nresults of operations. \ne) Defined benefit plans and compensated absences: \nThe cost of the defined benefit plans, compensated \nabsences and the present value of the defined benefit \nobligations are based on actuarial valuation using the \nprojected unit credit method.

The Company measures the expected \ncost of compensated absences as the additional \namount that the Company expects to pay as a result of \nthe unused entitlement that has accumulated at the \nend of the reporting period.

Equity instruments \ngranted are measured by reference to the fair value of the \ninstrument at the date of grant.

The early adoption of \namendments to IAS 1 did not have any material impact \non the consolidated financial statements.\nAmendments to IAS 8 \u2013 Accounting Policies, \nChanges in Accounting Estimates and Errors\nOn February 12, 2021, the IASB amended IAS 8 \n\u201cAccounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates \nand Errors\u201d . The amendments clarify how companies \nshould distinguish changes in accounting policies from \nchanges in accounting estimates. That distinction is \nimportant because changes in accounting estimates \nare applied prospectively only to future transactions and \nother future events, but changes in accounting policies \nare generally also applied retrospectively to past \ntransactions and other past events. The early adoption \nof amendments to IAS 8 did not have any material impact \non the consolidated financial statements.\nNew amendments not yet adopted: \nCertain new standards, amendments to standards and \ninterpretations are not yet effective for annual periods \nbeginning after April 1, 2021 and have not been applied \nin preparing these consolidated financial statements. \nNew standards, amendments to standards and \ninterpretations that could have potential impact on the \nconsolidated financial statements of the Company are: \nAmendments to IAS 37 \u2013 Onerous Contracts \u2013 \nCost of Fulfilling a Contract\nOn May 14, 2020, the IASB issued \u201cOnerous Contracts \u2014  \nCost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37)\u201d ,  amending the standard regarding costs a company \nshould include as the cost of fulfilling a contract when \nassessing whether a contract is onerous. The amendment \nspecifies that the \u201ccost of fulfilling\u201d a contract comprises \nthe \u201ccosts that relate directly to the contract\u201d . Costs that \nrelate directly to a contract can either be incremental \ncosts of fulfilling that contract or an allocation of other \ncosts that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. These \namendments are effective for annual reporting periods \nbeginning on or after January 1, 2022, with earlier \napplication permitted. The adoption of amendments to \nIAS 37 is not expected to have any material impact on the \nconsolidated financial statements.\nAmendment to IAS 1 \u2013 Presentation of \nFinancial Statements\nOn January 23, 2020, the IASB issued \u201cClassification \nof liabilities as Current or Non-Current (Amendments \nto IAS 1)\u201d providing a more general approach to the \nclassification of liabilities under IAS 1 based on the \ncontractual arrangement in place at the reporting \ndate. The amendments aim to promote consistency \nin applying the requirements by helping companies \nto determine whether, in the statement of financial \nposition, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain \nsettlement date should be classified as current (due \nor potentially due to be settled within one year) or \nnon-current. The amendments also clarified the \nclassification requirements for debt a company might \nsettle by converting it into equity. These amendments \nare effective for annual reporting periods beginning \non or after January 1, 2023 and are to be applied \nretrospectively, with earlier application permitted. The \nadoption of amendments to IAS 1 is not expected to \nhave any material impact on the consolidated financial \nstatements of the Company.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4546, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6b59e00-187a-48a6-bd90-076b55a3b945": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6b59e00-187a-48a6-bd90-076b55a3b945", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "304", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "08f33284-cb64-445e-ac8c-28e5fe180a22", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "304", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "7fb1f5454c60c21d85c33bd2334fa34aa2b9ded4891f2f12e9ff0fe7218ab8b3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4c203fea-459e-42ee-a11d-92bfb1d2fc70", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "304", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "368ce011fcaed787b3984d18cf002ae60230957fe9f59c2c5138a06ecb614f5a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3624d79c-c6b2-4ee9-9121-bd8db47e44a4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f0e72fe2e1ad754cd9205f1499746eb45a0e821945b393e7c38d9903b4418728", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The amendments aim to promote consistency \nin applying the requirements by helping companies \nto determine whether, in the statement of financial \nposition, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain \nsettlement date should be classified as current (due \nor potentially due to be settled within one year) or \nnon-current.

fair value of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, unbilled receivables, loans, borrowings and bank overdrafts, trade \npayables and accrued expenses, other current financial assets and liabilities approximate their carrying amount largely due to \nthe short-term nature of these instruments. The Company\u2019s long-term debt has been contracted at market rates of interest. \nAccordingly, the carrying value of such long-term debt approximates fair value. Further, finance lease receivables are periodically \nevaluated based on individual credit worthiness of customers. Based on this evaluation, the Company records allowance for \nestimated losses on these receivables. As at March 31, 2021 and 2022, the carrying value of such receivables, net of allowances \napproximates the fair value.\nInvestments in short-term mutual funds and fixed maturity plans, which are classified as FVTPL are measured using net asset \nvalues at the reporting date multiplied by the quantity held. Fair value of investments in non-convertible debentures, government \nsecurities, commercial papers, certificate of deposits and bonds classified as FVTOCI is determined based on the indicative \nquotes of price and yields prevailing in the market at the reporting date. Fair value of investments in equity instruments classified \nas FVTOCI or FVTPL is determined using market multiples method.\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined based on observable market inputs including currency spot and \nforward rates, yield curves, currency volatility etc.\nFair value hierarchy\nThe table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value, by valuation method.

unbilled receivables, \nnet investment in finance lease receivables (financial assets) to banks. Under the terms of the arrangements, the Company \nsurrenders control over the financial assets and transfer is without recourse. Accordingly, such transfers are recorded as sale \nof financial assets.

The incremental impact of such transactions on our cash \nflow and liquidity for the year ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 is not material.\n In certain cases, transfer of financial assets may be with recourse. Under arrangements with recourse, the Company is obligated \nto repurchase the uncollected financial assets, subject to limits specified in the agreement with the banks. These are reflected \nas part of loans and borrowings in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n Financial risk management \n Market Risk\n Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from a change in the price \nof a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign \ncurrency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable \nto all market risk sensitive financial instruments including investments, foreign currency receivables, payables and loans and \nborrowings.\n The Company\u2019s exposure to market risk is a function of investment and borrowing activities and revenue generating activities in \nforeign currency. The objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of the Company\u2019s earnings and equity \nto losses.\n Risk Management Procedures \n The Company manages market risk through a corporate treasury department, which evaluates and exercises independent \ncontrol over the entire process of market risk management. The corporate treasury department recommends risk management \nobjectives and policies, which are approved by senior management and Audit Committee. The activities of this department \ninclude management of cash resources, implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures, borrowing strategies, \nand ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies. \n Foreign currency risk \n The Company operates internationally, and a major portion of its business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently, the \nCompany is exposed to foreign exchange risk through receiving payment for sales and services in the United States of America \n(` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated financial statements under IFRS Consolidated financial statements under IFRS\n343\nIntegrated Annual Report 2021-22Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 4771, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c393ee4d-f74f-4e9d-818d-645e81c756dc": {"__data__": {"id_": "c393ee4d-f74f-4e9d-818d-645e81c756dc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "324", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8a64a0a1-42df-4d9c-9e07-e0e5ba85c4d6", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "324", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "e52884a48060b521a41835761de4c8373213d5471f3aed03ea8a37155218b4a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5e0fbf8f-94d0-4e01-98e8-646f39d06123", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "323", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "6831da492ae66089dddadfe795bebcc248e9d791648baa78cc60848b3a5bcd70", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "a0a2fcda-4b24-4a9d-8ee3-cd859069a202", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "34bc1756d1d54012e9d3a2e8ec83d56c2a17d0c0b23b33a86fd7b2c5684a04a5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "and elsewhere and making purchases from overseas suppliers in various foreign currencies.

primarily arises from floating rate borrowing, including various revolving and other lines of credit. The Company\u2019s \ninvestments are primarily in short-term investments, which do not expose it to significant interest rate risk. From time to time, \nthe Company manages its net exposure to interest rate risk relating to borrowings by entering into interest rate swap agreements, \nwhich allows it to exchange periodic payments based on a notional amount and agreed upon fixed and floating interest rates. \nCertain borrowings are also transacted at fixed interest rates. If interest rates were to increase by 100 bps as on March 31, 2022, \nadditional net annual interest expense on floating rate borrowing would amount to approximately ` 951.\n(` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated financial statements under IFRS Consolidated financial statements under IFRS\n344\nWipro Limited | Ambitions Realized", "start_char_idx": 3574, "end_char_idx": 4832, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f77630f7-cc20-4a01-927a-061296f76398": {"__data__": {"id_": "f77630f7-cc20-4a01-927a-061296f76398", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "325", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5508f349-9061-4b93-b447-be3d84792669", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "325", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "8852016fc61de70f32a1d3eb417ddeb1fa017a02dbbc625611168266a1d1b5e2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "38194dd7-817a-494c-923f-b1f8b705a631", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "324", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "5e24ed0b30bca318559511706e3f2a219726b8beb456c5bbe8c635394ca8ff15", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b88ae42a-6049-4fbf-bab5-b1d450485ce7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "6e009a57fcfae2c479e95c12da2a4b0a0bf1a3f8c7625e337af80bd8a3235763", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Credit risk\n Credit risk arises from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To manage this, the \nCompany periodically assesses the credit rating and financial reliability of customers, considering the financial condition, current \neconomic trends, forward looking macroeconomic information, analysis of historical bad debts and ageing of accounts receivable. \nIndividual risk limits are set accordingly. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the accounts receivable as at \nMarch 31, 2021 and 2022, or revenues for the year ended March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022. There is no significant concentration \nof credit risk. \n Counterparty risk\n Counterparty risk encompasses issuer risk on marketable securities, settlement risk on derivative and money market contracts \nand credit risk on cash and time deposits. Issuer risk is minimized by only buying securities which are at least AA rated in \nIndia based on Indian rating agencies. Settlement and credit risk is reduced by the policy of entering into transactions with \ncounterparties that are usually banks or financial institutions with acceptable credit ratings. Exposure to these risks are closely \nmonitored and maintained within predetermined parameters. There are limits on credit exposure to any financial institution. The \nlimits are regularly assessed and determined based upon credit analysis including financial statements and capital adequacy \nratio reviews. \n Liquidity risk \n Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable \nprice. The Company\u2019s corporate treasury department is responsible for liquidity and funding as well as settlement management. \nIn addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management.

Contract Assets and Liabilities\n The Company classifies its right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. \n A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional. A right to consideration is unconditional if only the passage of time is \nrequired before payment of that consideration is due. For example, the Company recognizes a receivable for revenues related to \ntime and materials contracts or volume based contracts. The Company presents such receivables as part of unbilled receivables \nat their net estimated realizable value. The same is tested for impairment as per the guidance in IFRS 9 using expected credit  \nloss method. \n Contract liabilities: During the year ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, the Company recognized revenue of ` 16,082 and \n` 18,880 arising from contract liabilities as at March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021 respectively.\n Contract assets: During the year ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, ` 15,101 and ` 13,944 of contract assets pertaining \nto fixed-price development contracts have been reclassified to receivables on completion of milestones.\n Contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nB. Remaining Performance Obligations\n Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which \nincludes contract liabilities and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Applying the practical \nexpedient, the Company has not disclosed its right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with \nthe value to the customer of the Company\u2019s performance completed to date, which are contracts invoiced on time and material \nbasis and volume based. \n As at March 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations, \nother than those meeting the exclusion criteria above, were ` 360,033, ` 384,881 and ` 328,191, respectively of which \napproximately 62%, 59% and 59% respectively is expected to be recognized as revenues within two years, and the remainder \nthereafter. This includes contracts with a substantive enforceable termination penalty if the contract is terminated without cause \nby the customer, based on an overall assessment of the contract carried out at the time of inception. Historically, customers have \nnot terminated contracts without cause.\nC. Disaggregation of Revenue\n The tables below present disaggregated revenue from contracts with customers by business segment (refer to Note 34 \u201cSegment \nInformation\u201d), sector and nature of contract. The Company believes that the below disaggregation best depicts the nature, \namount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows from economic factors.\n(` in millions, except share and per share data, unless otherwise stated)Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated financial statements under IFRS Consolidated financial statements under IFRS\n351\nIntegrated Annual Report 2021-22Statutory Reports and Financial Statements", "start_char_idx": 1, "end_char_idx": 3956, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "828c6f86-d9fb-43d6-92f7-c0c93b239e31": {"__data__": {"id_": "828c6f86-d9fb-43d6-92f7-c0c93b239e31", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "332", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "21a3dd6f-0ac8-4501-b024-43c0ca4e24e5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "332", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "2254a03d1df0cddef406b00e8f7fb37f800ddbfa1deb26347a4fcbfd2ccda267", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "953f08a8-6968-467c-911c-d4b8abb05aef", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "331", "file_name": "wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_path": "Assignment_dataset\\wipro-21-22.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 10115467, "creation_date": "2024-03-16", "last_modified_date": "2024-03-14"}, "hash": "3fa255365769a27acec4102a51bbd98ebc1421918e45629a425780ace0f9123d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "96e12dc2-e01e-4487-a7f1-a3f2320877dc", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9956318734e2035d46d560048e9128a858e5d9729c9627738a1776cb98862e57", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Information on disaggregation of revenues for the year ended March 31, 2020 is as follows:\nIT Services \nIT Products ISRE Total\nAmericas 1 Americas 2 Europe APMEA Total\nA.
